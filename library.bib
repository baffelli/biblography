@phdthesis{Pipia2009,
abstract = {Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) deals with the combination of multi-temporal SAR images for the estimation of the linear and non-linear components of the deformation process within an area of interest during the whole observation period. A high stability of the platform is required for a reliable estimation of the geodetic phenomena. Accordingly, space-borne SAR images are operatively employed for DInSAR estimation, air-borne DInSAR still constituting a challenging research issue. SAR Polarimetry aims at charactering the illuminated area through the analysis of its response under different combinations of transmitting and receiving antennas polarization, called polarimetric channels. The Polarimetric SAR Interferometry joins the capability of Polarimetry to separate independent scattering mechanisms and the sensitivity of Interferometry to the corresponding phase centers' elevation, making it possible to describe the volumetric distribution of the scatterers within the observed area. Owing to the lack of long-time collections of polarimetric space-borne SAR data, the studies carried out in this research field have been mainly based on air-borne acquisitions. Yet, there is a great expectation for the improvements that polarimetry may bring to assessed single-polarization techniques such as the DinSAR. The research described in this PhD dissertation fills for the first time the gap between SAR Polarimetry and SAR Differential Interferometry through the employment of an X-band ground-based SAR (gbSAR) sensor developed by the Remote Sensing Lab of the Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya (UPC). The work is divided into two main blocks. The first part deals with the algorithms that have been developed to make the UPC system operative and its acquisitions easy to use. Summarily, they include the mathematical formulation of the sensor's working principles, the raw data processing chain and the polarimetric calibration method, the geocoding procedures, and the techniques compensating for the atmospheric artefacts affecting gbSAR zero-baseline acquisitions. The second part is concerned with demonstrating the benefits that polarimetric SAR measurements provide with respect to single-polarization data for differential applications. In order to cope with this task, the data sets acquired during a one-year measurement campaign carried out in the village of Sallent, northeastern Spain, are analyzed. The experiment was focused on monitoring the subsidence phenomenon affecting a district of the village with the UPC gbSAR sensor. Three main issues are here argued. The first one is the time non-stationary behaviors characterizing the urban environment at X-band in the gbSAR observation geometry. Their effects are analyzed in detail and a novel non-stationary filtering technique tailored to deterministic scatterers' properties is introduced to preserve the differential phase information. The second one is the compensation of the troposphere changes in long-time span gbSAR differential interferograms. A new technique is worked out to effectively separate the differential phase variations due to the atmospheric artefacts from the deformation components. The third one is the use of the whole polarimetric differential information. A novel polarimetric differential scattering model is put forward to relax the constraints of an advanced DInSAR technique, the Coherent Pixel Technique, and to propose an innovative polarimetric approach. The advantages offered by Polarimetric DInSAR are demonstrated in terms of quality of the deformation-rate map describing the subsidence phenomenon in Sallent. In the end, the potentials of coherence-optimization techniques for the further improvement of the deformation process estimation are stressed.},

abstract = {The potential of differential SAR interferometry for land subsidence monitoring is reported on. The principle of the technique and the approach to be used on a specific case are first presented. Then significant results using SAR data from the ERS satellites for various sites in Germany, Mexico, and Italy, representing fast (m/year) to slow (mm/year) deformation velocities, are discussed. The SAR interferometric displacement maps are validated with available leveling data. The accuracy of the subsidence maps produced, the huge SAR data archive starting in 1991, the expected continued availability of SAR data, and the maturity of the required processing techniques lead to the conclusion that differential SAR interferometry is suitable for operational monitoring of land subsidence.},

It also proposes using postprocessing of the change detected by the MAD variates using maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) analysis. The MAD and the combined MAF/MAD transformations are invariant to linear scaling. Therefore, they are insensitive, for example, to differences in gain settings in a measuring device, or to linear radiometric and atmospheric correction schemes. Other multivariate change detection schemes described are principal component type analyses of simple difference images. Case studies with AHVRR and Landsat MSS data using simple linear stretching and masking of the change images show the usefulness of the new MAD and MAF/MAD change detection schemes. Ground truth observations confirm the detected changes. A simple simulation of a no-change situation shows the accuracy of the MAD and MAF/MAD transformations compared to principal components based methods.},

abstract = {In 1973, surface velocities were measured for the first time on an unstable hanging glacier to predict its collapse. The observed velocities have been shown to increase as a power-law function of time up to infinity at the theoretical time of failure (known as 'finite time singularity'). This is the characteristic signature of critical phenomena and has been observed in the case of various other naturally occurring ruptures such as earthquakes, landslides and snow avalanches. Recent velocity measurements performed on Weisshorn and M{\"{o}}nch hanging glaciers, Switzerland, confirmed this behaviour, while log-periodic oscillations superimposed on this general acceleration were also detected. Despite different rupture mechanisms in both cases, the log frequency of the oscillations is shown to be the same. The seismic activity was recorded near the unstable Weisshorn hanging glacier, simultaneously with the velocity measurements. Results show dramatically increasing icequake activity 3 days before the final collapse. Combined motion-seismic monitoring seems to be a promising way to accurately predict the breaking-off of hanging glaciers. Such a combined analysis is also useful for capturing the physical mechanisms of rupture in natural heterogeneous materials.},

abstract = {GROUND-BASED measurements of volcano deformation can be used to assess eruptive hazard, but require the costly (and often hazardous) installation and maintenance of an instrument network, Here we show that spaceborne radar interferometry, which has already shown its utility in mapping earthquake-related deformation(1), can be used to monitor long-term volcano deformation. Two families of synthetic aperture radar images, acquired from ascending and descending orbits by the satellite ERS-1, and looking at Mount Etna from opposite sides, cover the time period from 17 May 1992 to 24 October 1993, and include the second half of Etna's most recent eruption, Despite artefacts of the interferometric technique, we can observe a volcano-wide deflation, which is an expected consequence of the eruption, but which had not previously been appreciated, We quantify it using a simple model based on the change of pressure in a sphere located in an elastic half-space; the modelled deformation increases linearly with time until the end of the eruption. Our results show that it will be possible to use this technique to detect the inflation of volcanic edifices that usually precedes eruptions.},

@article{Olmsted1993,
abstract = {Radar sensing has been developed on the basis of four technological principles. These are: 1) the ability of an antenna to emit a brief electromagnetic pulse in a precise direction, 2) the ability to detect, also with directional precision, the greatly attenuated echo scattered from a target, 3) the ability to measure the time delay between emission and detection and thus the range to the target, and 4) the ability to scan with the directional beam and so examine an extended area for targets. A fifth principle, spectral analysis of precisely phase controlled signals, enables extreme enhancements of the application of the four physical principals. It is this last methodology which lies at the heart of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). By means of detection of small Doppler shifts in signals from targets in motion relative to the radar, it is possible to obtain, from limited peak power, imaging resolutions on the order of 3 arc seconds for spaceborne SAR and 0.01 arc second for planetary radar telescopy. These techniques depend on precise determination of the relative position and velocity of the radar with respect to the target, and on integrating the return signal information over a time period (or look ) which is long compared to the time between pulses (inter-pulse period , IPP).},

@article{Zebker1994,
abstract = {We present a map of the coseismic displacement field resulting from the Landers, California, June 28, 1992, earthquake derived using data acquired from an orbiting high-resolution radar system. We achieve results more accurate than previous space studies and similar in accuracy to those obtained by conventional field survey techniques. Data from the ERS 1 synthetic aperture radar instrument acquired in April, July, and August 1992 are used to generate a high-resolution, wide area map of the displacements. The data represent the motion in the direction of the radar line of sight to centimeter level precision of each 30-m resolution element in a 113 km by 90 km image. Our coseismic displacement contour map gives a lobed pattern consistent with theoretical models of the displacement field from the earthquake. Fine structure observed as displacement tiling in regions several kilometers from the fault appears to be the result of local surface fracturing. Comparison of these data with Global Positioning System and electronic distance measurement survey data yield a correlation of 0.96; thus the radar measurements are a means to extend the point measurements acquired by traditional techniques to an area map format. The technique we use is (1) more automatic, (2) more precise, and (3) better validated than previous similar applications of differential radar interferometry. Since we require only remotely sensed satellite data with no additional requirements for ancillary information, the technique is well suited for global seismic monitoring and analysis.},

abstract = {Several techniques for detecting temporal changes in satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are compared using both theoretical predictions and spaceborne SAR data collected by the European first Remote Sensing Satellite, ERS- 1. In a first set of techniques, changes are detected based on differences in the magnitude of the signal intensity between two dates. Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large. In a second set of techniques, changes are detected based on estimates of the temporal decorrelation of speckle. This method works best with one-look complex amplitude data, but can also be used with intensity data provided that the number of looks is small. The two techniques, ratioing of the signal intensity and decorrelation of speckle, are compared using actual SAR data collected by ERS-1. The results illustrate the viability as well as the complementary character of these techniques for detecting changes in the structural and dielectric properties of remotely sensed surfaces. Finally, change detection using the ratio method is applied to mosaics of repeat-pass SAR imagery to illustrate the potential of this method for monitoring applications at the regional scale.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for a measure of coherent similarity between temporal multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and its implementation to change detection application. The method is based on mutual infor- mation (MI) from information theory. The MI measures the amount of information in common between coherent temporal multichannel SAR acquisitions. In order to develop an algo- rithm for all kinds of SAR images, such as interferometric SAR, polarimetric–interferometric SAR (PolInSAR), and partial PolIn- SAR, first, the joint density function of temporal multichannel images based on their second-order statistics has been derived. Then, the derived joint density function is used to calculate an analytical expression for the MI between temporal images, which is assumed to be maximal if the temporal images are identical. Although, in this paper, a new coherent similarity measure has analytically been derived for temporal polarimetric SAR images based on complexWishart process in time, since the mathematical formulation is general, it can equally well be implemented into any kind of multivariate remote sensing data, such as multispec- tral optical and interferometric images after small continuation. This derived quantity has been implemented for change detection application whose aim is to characterize the temporal behavior of the acquisitions. A comparison between the proposed and the other well-known change detection methods by means of scene characterization is shown, describing the advantages due to the fact that the proposed change detector involves almost every facet of applied change detection.},

The work is then focused on the additional information the knowledge of full scattering matrix [S] may provide with respect to the single polarization approach. The problem of instability of the polarimetric signature of urban targets is also analyzed. Finally, a solution based on the search of repeated patterns in the long-temporal profile of pixels' polarimetric signature is briefly introduced.},

abstract = {The paper presents an idea of nonuniform spatial sampling applied to a noise synthetic aperture radar. In certain cases it is desirable to limit the number of spatial (along-track) domain samples acquired in a SAR radar because of external constraints on sampling frequency or on the overall number of samples - e.g. in order to economy on time or power consumed. Lowering number of samples taken may, however, lead to spatial aliasing and incorrect reconstruction of the image. Nonuniform sampling allows to reduce the aliasing effect and reconstruct the image better. This technique can be applied with standard reconstruction methods, but it works best together with Compressive Sensing reconstruction algorithms. The idea will be verified with an experimental noise SAR built at ISE PW.},

abstract = {Airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating in the VHF band and used in conjunction with change detection has shown promising results for wide-area surveillance of ground targets. By using VHF-band frequencies, both targets in the open as well as concealed by foliage may be detected in a robust manner. VHF-band SAR is able to detect hidden targets because both foliage attenuation and clutter backscatter is small. The clutter is further suppressed through the use of change detection, thus significantly reducing the false alarms. VHF-band SAR is suitable for change detection since temporal decorrelation is small. An extensive data base of VHF-band SAR and target data was collected during the summer of 2002. The primary goal of this collection was to evaluate VHF-band SAR change detection performance under various operating conditions. In general, the results show that a VHF-band SAR employing change detection can reliably detect truck-sized targets hidden in foliage. However, the detection performance deteriorates under certain operating conditions, e.g. for near-grazing angles.},

@article{Preiss2006,
abstract = {In repeat-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), man-made scene disturbances are commonly detected by identifying changes in the mean backscatter power of the scene or by identifying regions of low coherence. Change statistics such as the sample mean backscatter-power ratio and the sample coherence, however, are susceptible to high false-alarm rates unless the change in the mean backscatter power is large or there is sufficient contrast in scene coherence between the changed and unchanged regions of the image pair. Furthermore, as the sample mean backscatter-power ratio and sample coherence measure different properties of a SAR image pair, both change statistics need to be considered to properly characterize scene changes. In this paper, models describing the changed and unchanged regions of a scene are postulated, and the detection problem is expressed in a Bayesian hypothesis-testing framework. Forming the log-likelihood ratio gives a single sufficient statistic, encoding changes in both the coherence and the mean backscatter power, for discriminating between the unchanged- and changed-scene models. The theoretical detection performance of the change statistic is derived and shows a significant improvement over both the sample mean backscatter-power ratio and sample coherence change statistics. Finally, the superior detection performance of the log-likelihood change statistic is demonstrated using experimental data collected using the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Ingara X-band airborne SAR},

The latter has a complex Wishart distribution. A maximum likelihood classifier to segment polarimetric SAR data according to terrain types has been developed based on the Wishart distribution. This algorithm can also be applied to multi-frequency multi-look polarimetric SAR data, as well as to SAR data containing only intensity information. A procedure is then developed for unsupervised classification. The classification error is assessed by using Monte Carlo simulation of multi-look polarimetric SAR data, owing to the lack of ground truth for each pixel. Comparisons of classification errors using the training sets and single-look data are also made. Applications of this algorithm are demonstrated with NASA/JPL P-, L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data.},

It is not possible to get both high range and angular resolution in a radar using the slotted waveguide antenna. An expression is derived which shows that the product of range and angular resolution is constant. Therefore, if the angular resolution is increased, then range resolution will be decreased. For example, a slotted waveguide antenna of 6-m length gave a beamwidth of 0.4 degrees . The transmitted pulsewidth could not be lowered below 3T/sub t/=84 ns at 9375 MHz, where T/sub t/ is the transit time.},

Unlike interferometric measurement of wide-field deformation, atmospheric propagation heterogeneity is not an accuracy-limiting factor. Although the radar data confirm prior knowledge concerning the landslide, such an application of SAR interferometry appears difficult under normal conditions of observation using current spaceborne radar systems. The study of soil subsidence, however, can be generalized and improves prior knowledge of the displacement field, which has here been modeled assuming elastic deformation in a half-space from several sources. The two examples help to understand the limits of the interferometric technique.},

abstract = {Die Internationale Rheinschutzkommission (IKSR) koordiniert seit 1990 biologische Bestandsaufnahmen vom Bodensee bis zur Nordsee. In diesem Rahmen wurde im Auftrag des Bundesamtes f{\"{u}}r Umwelt (BAFU, Bern) und der Landesanstalt f{\"{u}}r Um- welt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg (LUBW) im Herbst 2006 und im Fr{\"{u}}hjahr 2007 bereits zum vierten Mal seit 1990 das Zoobenthos des Hochrheins untersucht. Die Aufnahmen fanden wieder an neun repr{\"{a}}sentativen Flussquerschnitten zwischen Bodensee und Basel statt. Diese repr{\"{a}}sentieren den Bodenseeabfluss (Ab- schnitt A), den naturnahen Hochrhein oberhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (Abschnitt B), den ausgebauten und staubeeinflussten Hochrhein unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (Abschnitt C) und den durch Grossschiffahrt gepr{\"{a}}gten Hochrhein von Rheinfelden bis Basel (Abschnitt D). Im L{\"{a}}ngsverlauf des Hochrheins wurden wie in fr{\"{u}}heren Kampagnen deutliche Unter- schiede in der Besiedlung der Flusssohle festgestellt: in naturnahen Hochrheinabschnit- ten oberhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (A und B) dominierten wie bisher die Wasserinsekten. In den Rheinabschnitten unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (C und D) waren es Mollusken (Muscheln und Schnecken) und Crustaceen (Krebstiere). Zwischen 1995 und 2007 liessen sich deutliche Ver{\"{a}}nderungen der Sohlenbesiedlung feststellen. Die Flusskahnschnecke Theodoxus fluviatilis, 1995 noch eine der dominan- ten Arten im Raum Basel, verschwand bis 2002 v{\"{o}}llig aus dem Hochrhein. Die Be- st{\"{a}}nde der Zebramuschel Dreissena polymorpha gingen seit etwa 2000 unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung stark zur{\"{u}}ck. Anderen, dort zuvor ebenfalls h{\"{a}}ufigen Taxa erging es {\"{a}}hnlich: Flohkrebsarten der Gattung Gammarus, die Eintagsfliege Heptagenia sulphu- rea und die K{\"{o}}cherfliege Cheumatopsyche lepida sind sehr selten geworden; Strudel- w{\"{u}}rmer, die Schnecke Bithynia tentaculata, Eintagsfliegen der Gattung Baetis und Kriebelm{\"{u}}cken (Simulium sp.) wurden gar nicht mehr nachgewiesen. Ursache f{\"{u}}r diese Ver{\"{a}}nderungen ist offensichtlich das aggressive Frass- und Raumnutzungsverhalten invasiver Neozoenarten, von denen sich seit 1995 mindestens sechs neu im unteren Hochrhein etabliert haben. Dagegen weist die Benthosbesiedlung in den naturnahen oberen Hochrheinabschnitten noch immer eine stabile Besiedlung mit angestammten Arten auf. Massenvermehrungen von Neozoen sind auch f{\"{u}}r die erheblichen Unterschiede in den Biomassewerten verantwortlich. W{\"{a}}hrend naturnahe Stellen nur geringe Benthos- Biomassen aufwiesen, lagen diese an Stellen unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung mit hohen Dichten der K{\"{o}}rbchenmuschel Corbicula fluminea und der grossen neozoischen Floh- krebse um ein Vielfaches h{\"{o}}her. Im Bodenseeabfluss bei Hemishofen sorgten die noch immer dichten Best{\"{a}}nde der Zebramuschel f{\"{u}}r eine hohe Biomasse. Die im Hochrhein vorhandene Nahrungsgrundlage wirkt sich also auf die Massenvermehrung von invasi- ven Neozoen nicht limitierend aus. Grenzen werden ihnen lediglich durch das jeweilige Lebensraumangebot und die selektiv wirkenden Umgebungsfaktoren (Temperatur, Str{\"{o}}mung, Substrat) gesetzt. Im naturnahen Hochrheinabschnitt B konnten sich invasive Neozoenarten noch nicht etablieren. Auch im Abschnitt A, wo der grosse H{\"{o}}ckerflohkrebs Dikerogammarus villosus vom Bodensee her eingedrungen ist, war noch kein negativer Einfluss auf die angestammte Benthosbioz{\"{o}}nose zu erkennen. Dies l{\"{a}}sst den Schluss zu, dass die weitere massive Ausbreitung von Neozoen nur begrenzt werden kann, wenn die Le- bensbedingungen und Konkurrenzvorteile der typischen Rheinarten durch eine natur- nahe Morphologie, Str{\"{o}}mungs- und Abflusscharakteristik des Hochrheins erhalten und gef{\"{o}}rdert werden.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new automatic change detection technique for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series, i.e., Method for generalIzed Means Ordered Series Analysis (MIMOSA). The method compares only two different temporal means between the amplitude images, whatever the length of the time series. The method involves three different steps: 1) estimation of the amplitude distribution parameters over the images; 2) computation of the theoretical joint probability density function between the two temporal means; and 3) automatic thresholding according to a given false alarm rate, which is the only change detection parameter. The procedure is executed with a very low computational cost and does not require any spatial speckle filtering. Indeed, the full image resolution is used. Due to the temporal means, the data volume to process is reduced, which is very helpful. Moreover, the two means can be simply updated using the new incoming images only. Thus, the full time series is not processed again. Change detection results between image pairs are presented with the airborne sensor CARABAS-II, using a public data release, and with TerraSAR-X data. In the case of time series, change detection results are illustrated using a TerraSAR-X time series. In every case, the MIMOSA method produces very good results.},

abstract = {A new submillimeter-wave imaging system based on the frequency scanning concept is presented. Using significantly less information than beam-steering techniques, frequency scanning-based imaging systems are able to provide angular information in range-based radar systems which do not allow mechanical or electronic beam steering. Several strategies have been adopted to overcome the low dynamic range due to the propagation losses and non-specular reflection on the object-under-test. Moreover, the system is not only capable of detecting the placement of the objects, but also their profile. In this sense, an imaging application showing the system capabilities for the detection of objects concealed under clothes is presented. Results using 1-D FSAA allowing profile imaging are shown, proving the validity of the proposed system.},

The scattering entropy is a key parameter is determining the randomness in this model and is seen as a funda- mental parameter in assessing the importance of polarimetry in remote sensing problems. We show application of the method to some important classical random media scattering problems and apply it to POLSAR data from the NASA/JPL AIRSAR data base.},

Most radiometric slope corrections remove slope effects$\backslash$nto account for the effective scattering pixel area. However, few studies$\backslash$naddress the slope effect on the radar cross section as a function of$\backslash$npolarization states. The authors propose two approaches to compensate$\backslash$nfor this azimuth slope effect for POLSAR data. In the first approach,$\backslash$nthe digital elevation model (DEM), obtained from interferometric SAR or$\backslash$nfrom other means, is used to estimate orientation angles, and in the$\backslash$nsecond approach, orientation angles are derived directly from the POLSAR$\backslash$ndata. They have developed three new methods to implement this second$\backslash$napproach. One is based on the right-right and left-left circular$\backslash$npolarizations, and the other two are based on Cloude's and Huynelt's$\backslash$ndecompositions. The results are compared with the original polarization$\backslash$nsignature method using the DEM-generated orientation angles as the$\backslash$nreference. POLSAR data is then compensated using the derived orientation$\backslash$nangles. Significant changes were observed in many elements of the$\backslash$ncoherency matrix.

In this paper, a new PolSAR change detector which makes use of Kullback-Leibler divergence is described. Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) measures the amount of information in common between coherent temporal multi-channel polarimetric SAR acquisitions. Although in this paper KL-divergence measure has analytically been derived for temporal polarimetric SAR images based on complex Wishart process in time, since the mathematical formulation is general, it can be implemented into any kind of multivariate remote sensing data such as multi-spectral optical and interferometric images. KL-divergence measure is also simplified to give an explicit expressions for temporal single channel SAR images. The new results are simple, easy to be used, and superior in providing detailed structure.},

abstract = {This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in the use of terrestrial radar interferometry for the detection of surface changes related to mass movement. Different hardware-types and acquisition concepts are described, which use either real or synthetic aperture for radar image formation. We present approaches for data processing procedures, paying special attention to the separation of high resolution displacement information from atmospheric phase variations. Recent case studies are used to illustrate applications in terrestrial radar interferometry for change detection. Applications range from detection and quantification of very slow moving (millimeters to centimeters per year) displacements in rock walls from repeat monitoring, to rapid processes resulting in fast displacements (50m/yr) acquired during single measurement campaigns with durations of only a few hours. Fast and episodic acting processes such as rockfall and snow avalanches can be assessed qualitatively in the spatial domain by mapping decorrelation caused by those processes. A concluding guide to best practice outlines the necessary preconditions that have to be fulfilled for successful application of the technique, as well as in areas characterized by rapid decorrelation. Empirical data from a Ku-band sensor show the range of temporal decorrelation of different surfaces after more than two years for rock-surfaces and after a few seconds to minutes in vegetated areas during windy conditions. The examples show that the displacement field can be measured for landslides in dense grassland, ice surfaces on flowing glaciers and snowpack creep. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Hondt2013,
abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an iterative speckle filtering method for polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images based on the bilateral filter. To locally adapt to the spatial structure of images, this filter relies on pixel similarities in both spatial and radiometric domains. To deal with polarimetric data, we study the use of similarities based on a statistical distance called Kullback-Leibler divergence as well as two geodesic distances on Riemannian manifolds. To cope with speckle, we propose to progressively refine the result thanks to an iterative scheme. Experiments are run over synthetic and experimental data. First, simulations are generated to study the effects of filtering parameters in terms of polarimetric reconstruction error, edge preservation and smoothing of homogeneous areas. Comparison with other methods shows that our approach compares well to other state of the art methods in the extraction of polarimetric information and shows superior performance for edge restoration and noise smoothing. The filter is then applied to experimental data sets from ESAR and FSAR sensors (DLR) at L-band and S-band, respectively. These last experiments show the ability of the filter to restore structures such as buildings and roads and to preserve boundaries between regions while achieving a high amount of smoothing in homogeneous areas.},

@article{Kovesi2015,
abstract = {Many colour maps provided by vendors have highly uneven perceptual contrast over their range. It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots that can hide a feature as large as one tenth of the total data range. Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance of false features. Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.},

In the first case, an external digital elevation model was used to assess the error of topography mapping with the portable radar interferometer and to analyze ice surface changes of the glacier in the last 14 years. We found that the height error standard deviation is about 3 m within a distance of 2 km from the sensor and observed massive thinning of the Rhone glacier. In the second case, we used the terrestrial radar interferometer in order to measure the height difference between August 2009 and March 2010 over the rock glacier as a consequence of its destabilization.},

Due to the high sampling frequency and the amount of data that would be produced, on-board processing would be necessary to more efficiently use the communication link, a link that would become a bottleneck if nothing was conducted on the data. An FPGA was recommended for performing the on-board processing. This thesis focuses on the implementation of a proposed SAR processor that will be used to process the raw SAR data inWavemill. The SAR processor was synthesized for a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA and simulation verified the design for the range compression component. The synthesis showed that implementation of the proposed real-time SAR processor was possible. The synthesis also showed that the SAR processor would function with a clock frequency of minimum 240 MHz.},

For example, in Earth observation missions, it is possible to estimate the salinity of oceans, the soil moisture of landscapes, or to extract atmospheric parameters like the liquid water content of clouds [1, 2, 3]. Due to the penetration capabilities of microwaves through many dielectric materials, and the purely passive character of this kind of remote sensing, this technique nowadays is considered as well in many security and reconnaissance applications (e.g. observation of sensitive areas, detection of concealed objects, trough-wall imaging, etc.). Presently different imaging principles for MW radiometry are possible. Most of them still are based on pure mechanical scanning or they combine this with electronic scanning by using parts of a focal plane array [4]. Due to many advantages, the technological trend is going towards fully-electronic beam steering or two-dimensional focal plane arrays. These systems are able to achieve high frame rates, but they are still very expensive because of a significantly higher number of receiver modules, compared to a mechanical scanning system. In our approach a novel concept for a Ka band fully-electronic wide swath MW imaging radiometer system is introduced [5]. It is based on a combination of beam steering by frequency shift for one scanning direction using a slottedwaveguide antenna, and the application of aperture synthesis in the other. In the following a proof of concept is outlined using a two-element interferometer system called VESAS (Voll elektronischer Scanner mit Apertursynthese) demonstrator. The advantage of using the aperture synthesis technique is the possibility to implement minimal redundant sparse arrays without a degradation of the antenna pattern. In combination with the beam steering by frequency shift, one requires a one dimensional receiver/antenna array for a two dimensional imaging, hence a low-cost, fully-electronic wide swath microwave radiometer system with high frame rates is feasible. In the following a proof of concept is outlined by presenting different MW imaging measurement results, using this kind of imaging principle.{\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

For this, a polarimetric coherent scattering model for vegetation cover suitable for the estimation of forest parameters frominterfer- ometric observables is introduced, discussed and validated. Based on this model, an inversion algorithm which allows the estimation of forest parameters such as tree height, average extinction, and underlying topography from single-baseline fully polarimetric in- terferometric data is addressed. The performance of the inversion algorithm is demonstrated using fully polarimetric single baseline experimental data acquired by DLR's E-SAR system at L-band.},

abstract = {The classical point measurement methods for, soil moisture content and surface roughness, are described. The ground data acquisition as well as the SAR data acquisition campaign were performed with the E-SAR of the German Aerospace Center at Oberpfaffenhofen (DLR-OP- IHR) over two test sites in Germany, the Elbe-Auen and the Weiherbach region. The basic principles of SAR and radar polarimetry are introduced in order to provide the conceptual framework for the inversion of surface parameters from fully polarimetric SAR data, which includes the critical assessment of various novel polarimetric concepts. The prevalent methods for estimating the surface parameters from polarimetric SAR data are critically reviewed. The small perturbation model and two semi-empirical models are forming the basis of a comparative analysis. These two semi-empirical models were chosen in order to provide an overview of the evolution of ideas and techniques in the area of quantitative surface parameter estimation utilising partially polarimetric SAR image data takes. Further, the potential of polarimetric techniques recently developed in different application areas are investigated with regard to their suitability to improve the performance of the introduced inversion algorithms. First, the potential for applying the polarimetric decomposition techniques was addressed in order to repress the disturbing influence of secondary scattering processes, resulting from rough surface scatter. Then, the potential to estimate terrain slopes from fully polarimetric data utilising polarimetric techniques only is investigated and discussed as an attractive alternative to the standard method of using a-priori terrain information. A new model for the inversion of surface parameters from polarimetric SAR image data takes, the Extended Bragg Model, is introduced. The main advantages and disadvantages of this alternate model are discussed. Finally, future perspectives on how to extend the model by implementation of recent advances in polarimetric SAR interferometry are presented.},

abstract = {This is the first in a series of two papers on the use of active microwave remote sensing for measuring the moisture content of bare (Part I) and vegetation-covered (Part II) soil. An experimental program was conducted to evaluate the response of the backscattering coefficient to soil moisture content as a means to specify radar system parameters for future airborne and/or spaceborne soil moisture mappers. Particular attention was paid to the effects of surface roughness, and a preliminary examination of the role of soil texture was performed. The results of this investigation confirm the findings of a previous experiment [1] which concluded that the effects of surface roughness can be minimized by operating at a frequency in the neighborhood of 5 GHz over the 7-17° angle of incidence range. The precision with which soil moisture in the surface soil layer can be estimated is comparable to the precision of the ground-truthed estimate. Because the moisture in the surface layer is highly correlated to the subsurface moisture, it was not possible to determine experimentally the effective depth of the layer responsible for the observed radar backscatter.},

abstract = {This work deals with unsupervised change detection in temporal sets of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We focus on one of the most widely used change detector in the SAR context, the so-called log-ratio. In order to deal with the classification issue, we propose to use a new fuzzy version of hidden Markov chains (HMCs), and thus to address fuzzy change detection with a statistical approach. The main characteristic of the proposed model is to simultaneously use Dirac and Lebesgue measures at the class chain level. This allows the coexistence of hard pixels (obtained with the classical HMC segmentation) and fuzzy pixels (obtained with the fuzzy measure) in the same image. The quality assessment of the proposed method is achieved with several bidate sets of simulated images, and comparisons with classical HMC are also provided. Experimental results on real European Remote Sensing 2 Precision Image (ERS-2 PRI) images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine the role of polarimetry in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry.We first propose a general formulation for vector wave interferometry that includes conventional scalar interferometry as a special case. Then, we show how polarimetric basis transformations can be introduced into SAR interferometry and applied to form interferograms between all possible linear combinations of polarization states. This allows us to reveal the strong polarization dependency of the interferometric coherence. We then solve the coherence optimization problem involving maximization of interferomet- ric coherence and formulate a new coherent decomposition for polarimetric SAR interferometry that allows the separation of the effective phase centers of different scattering mechanisms. A simplified stochastic scattering model for an elevated forest canopy is introduced to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In this way, we demonstrate the impor- tance of wave polarization for the physical interpretation of SAR interferograms. We investigate the potential of polarimetric SAR interferometry using results from the evaluation of fully polarimetric interferometric shuttle imaging radar (SIR)-C/X- SAR data collected during October 8–9, 1994, over the SE Baikal Lake Selenga delta region of Buriatia, Southeast Siberia, Russia.},

abstract = {The traveling-wave slot antenna is similar to a traveling-wave wire antenna, but it is far more versatile because the phase velocity and rate of radiation of the fields in the antenna can be controlled. Four types of traveling-wave slot antennas have been identified. These are: (a) the conventional transverse electric, TE (no tangential E field parallel to the slot length); (b) transverse magnetic, TM (no tangential H field parallel to the slot length); (c) a hybrid with negligible transverse E, and (d) a hybrid with negligible normal H. Only the hybrid types are capable of producing maximum radiation in the direction of the slot axis (i. e., end-fire radiation). The complex propagation constant which is characteristic of uniform traveling-wave slots has been measured for a variety of waveguide geometries and is presented in the form of graphs. The radiation pattern of a traveling-wave slot can be controlled to give low side lobe or "cosecant squared" type patterns by appropriate variation of slot width with distance z along the axis. An approximate formula for the variation of attenuation {\^{A}}¿ with z required to give a specified pattern can be derived. This in turn gives the required variation of slot width with z. An examination of the principle of superposition shows that the conventional technique of array design is an approximation which has proved inadequate in the design of certain slot arrays.},

abstract = {The field of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is now in a stage where serious applications of societal and economical importance are in reach. For example, it is well known that the global climate change dramatically influences the visual appearance of mountain areas like the European Alps. Very destructive geological processes may be triggered or intensified, impacting the stability of slopes, possibly inducing landslides. Unfortunately, the interactions between these complex processes is poorly understood. Therefore, one needs to develop wireless sensing technology as a new scientific instrument for environmental sensing under extreme conditions. Large variations in temperature, humidity, mechanical forces, snow coverage, and unattended operation play a crucial role in long-term deployments. We argue that, in order to significantly advance the application domain, it is inevitable that sensor networks be created as a quality scientific instrument with known and predictable properties, and not as a research toy delivering average observations at best. In this paper, key techniques for achieving highly reliable, yet resource efficient wireless sensor networks are discussed on the basis of productive wireless sensor networks measuring permafrost processes in the Swiss Alps.},

abstract = {A comprehensive overview of the basic principles of radar polarimetry is presented. The relevant fundamental field equations are first provided. The importance of the propagation and scattering behavior in various frequency bands, the electrodynamic foundations such as Maxwell's equations, the Helmholtz vector wave equation and especially the fundamental laws of polarization will first be introduced: The fundamental terms which represent the polarization state will be introduced, defined and explained. Main points of view are the polarization Ellipse, the polarization ratio, the Stokes Parameter and the Stokes and Jones vector formalisms as well as its presentation on the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere and on relevant map projections. The Polarization Fork descriptor and the associated van Zyl polarimetric power density and Agrawal polarimetric phase correlation signatures will be introduced also in order to make understandable the polarization state formulations of electromagnetic waves in the frequency domain. The polarization state of electromagnetic waves under scattering conditions i.e. in the radar case will be described by matrix formalisms. Each scatterer is a polarization transformer; under normal conditions the transformation from the transmitted wave vector to the received wave vector is linear and this behavior, principally, will be described by a matrix called scattering matrix. This matrix contains all the information about the scattering process and the scatterer itself. The different relevant matrices, the respective terms like Jones Matrix, S-matrix, M{\"{u}}ller M-matrix, Kennaugh K- matrix, etc. and its interconnections will be defined and described together with change of polarization bases transformation operators, where upon the optimal (Characteristic) polarization states are determined for the coherent and partially coherent cases, respectively. The lecture is concluded with a set of simple examples},

abstract = {Temporal and geometrical decorrelation often prevents SAR interferometry from being an operational tool for surface deformation monitoring and topographic profile reconstruction. Moreover, atmospheric disturbances can strongly compromise the accuracy of the results. The authors present a complete procedure for the identification and exploitation of stable natural reflectors or permanent scatterers (PSs) starting from long temporal series of interferometric SAR images. When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used},

abstract = {Uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) is a reconfigurable polarimetric L-band SAR that operates in quad-polarization mode and is specifically designed to acquire airborne repeat-track SAR data for interferometric measurements. In this paper, we present details of the UAVSAR radar performance, the radiometric calibration, and the polarimetric calibration. For the radiometric calibration, we employ an array of trihedral corner reflectors, as well as distributed targets. We show that UAVSAR is a well-calibrated SAR system for polarimetric applications, with absolute radiometric calibration bias better than 1 dB, residual root-mean-square (RMS) errors of {\~{}}0.7 dB, and RMS phase errors {\~{}}5.3{\&}{\#}x00B0;. For the polarimetric calibration, we have evaluated the methods of Quegan and Ainsworth et al. for crosstalk calibration and find that the method of Quegan gives crosstalk estimates that depend on target type, whereas the method of Ainsworth et al. gives more stable crosstalk estimates. We find that both methods estimate leakage of the copolarizations into the cross-polarizations to be on the order of -30 dB.},

@article{Ulaby1987,
abstract = {This paper examines the statistical behavior of the phase difference AO between the HH-polarized and VV-polarized backscattered signals recorded by an L-band SAR over an agricultural test site in Illinois. Polarization-phase difference ({\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿) distributions were generated for about 200 agricultural fields for which ground information had been acquired in conjunction with the SAR mission. For the over-whelming majority of cases, the AX distribution is symmetrical and has a single major lobe centered at the mean value of the disstribution {\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿ Whereas the mean AX was found to be close to zero degrees for bare soil, cut vegetation, alfalfa, soybeans, and clover, a different pattern was observed for the corn fields; the mean {\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿ increased with increasing incidence angle 0 from about zero at 0 = 150 (near-range of the image) to about 140{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}° at 0 = 35{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}°. The explanation proposed for this variation is that the corn canopy, most of whose mass is contained in its vertical stalks, acts like a uniaxial crystal characterized by different velocities of propogation for waves with horizontal and vertical polarization. Thus, it is hypothesized that the observed backscatter is contributed by a combination of propagation delay, forward scatter by the soil surface, and specular bistatic reflection by the stalks. Model calculations based on this assumption were found to be in general agreement with the phase observations.},

abstract = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PolInSAR) combines SAR polarimetry and SAR interferometry and is much more sensitive to the distribution of orientated scatterers compared with polarimetric or interferometric data alone. The polarimetric similarity parameter is an efficient parameter to analyze target characteristics using the similarity between a target and the canonical target. In this letter, the polarimetric interferometric eigenvalue similarity parameter (PIESP) is proposed based on the similarity between two polarimetric SAR images obtained by two interferometric antennas. The PIESP is defined by the eigenvalues of two polarimetric coherence matrices in the PolInSAR system, and the eigenvalues of polarimetric coherence matrix are independent on the target orientation angle; therefore, the PIESP is rotation invariant. PolInSAR systems use two antennas to measure the same ground area with slightly different image geometry. Thus, the PIESP can be used to distinguish the target based on coherence and similarity. Then, the target detection method using the PIESP is implemented with the DLR experimental SAR L-band full polarized image of the Oberpfaffenhofen test site of Germany obtained on September 30, 2000. The results confirmed that the proposed model is accurate and effective for the detection and the analysis of buildings in urban areas.},

abstract = {In this paper, a study of polarimetric optimization techniques in the frame of differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) is considered. Historically, DInSAR techniques have been limited to the single-polarimetric case, mainly due to the unavailability of fully polarimetric data. Lately, the launch of satellites with polarimetric capabilities, such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), RADARSAT-2, or TerraSAR-X, allowed merging polarimetric and interferometric techniques to improve the pixels' phase quality and, thus, the density and the reliability of the final DInSAR results. The relationship between the polarimetrically optimized coherence or amplitude dispersion maps and the final DInSAR results is carefully analyzed, using both orbital and ground-based SAR fully polarimetric data. DInSAR processing using polarimetric optimization techniques in the pixel selection process is compared with the classical single-polarimetric approach, achieving up to a threefold increase of the number of pixel candidates in the coherence case and up to a factor of seven in the amplitude dispersion case.},

abstract = {A convenient polarimetric radar calibration technique is presented and used to calibrate an X band polarimetric radar. The technique uses a distortion matrix model for the errors introduced by the transmitter and receiver, and it is applicable to any polarimetric radar system where the concept of an invariant distortion matrix is valid. A sphere and two arbitrary passive targets are used to calibrate the radar with respect to the unknown polarization transmitted when the v-polarized channel is energized. The unknown transmitted polarization is then recovered by measuring any nondepolar- izing target. Because knowledge of the scattering matrices for the two arbitrary targets is not required, the technique is insensitive to errors in the orientation of calibration targets. Experimental results are presented, and they indicate magnitude and relative phase measurement errors of less than 0.2 dB and 2 {\o}, respectively.},

abstract = {In image processing, restoration is expected to improve the qualitative inspection of the image and the performance of quantitative image analysis techniques. In this paper, an adaptation of the nonlocal (NL)-means filter is proposed for speckle reduction in ultrasound (US) images. Originally developed for additive white Gaussian noise, we propose to use a Bayesian framework to derive a NL-means filter adapted to a relevant ultrasound noise model. Quantitative results on synthetic data show the performances of the proposed method compared to well-established and state-of-the-art methods. Results on real images demonstrate that the proposed method is able to preserve accurately edges and structural details of the image.},

abstract = {Target detectors using polarimetry are often focused on single targets, since these can be characterized in a simpler and deterministic way. The algorithm proposed in this paper is aimed at the more difficult problem of partial-target detection (i.e., targets with arbitrary degree of polarization). The authors have already proposed a single-target detector employing filters based on a geometrical perturbation. In order to enhance the algorithm to the detection of partial targets, a new vector formalism is introduced. The latter is similar to the one exploited for single targets but suitable for complete characterization of partial targets. A new feature vector is generated starting from the covariance matrix and exploited for the perturbation method. Validation against L-band fully polarimetric airborne E-SAR and ALOS PALSAR data and X-band dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X data is provided with significant agreement with the expected results. Additionally, a comparison with the supervised Wishart classifier is presented revealing improvements.},

@article{Werner2008,
abstract = {Satellite interferometry has been used extensively for ground-motion monitoring with good success. In the case of landslides, for example, space-borne SAR interferometry has a good potential to get an overview on the slope stability. The role of a space-borne INSAR as an element in a landslide or rock fall warning system is constrained by the specific space-borne SAR imaging geometry, the typical multiple-week repeat-interval, and uncertainties in the data availability. Most of these limitations can be overcome with an in-situ radar imaging system. GAMMA has developed a portable radar interferometer that utilizes real-aperture antennas to obtain high azimuth resolution. Images are acquired line by line while rotating the transmitting and receiving antennas about a vertical axis. Phase differences between successive images acquired from the same location are used to determine line-of-sight displacements. The instrument operates at 17.2 GHz and has measurement sensitivity better than 1 mm. The instrument uses two receiving antennas with a short baseline to form an interferometer. Phase differences between simultaneous acquisitions by these antennas are used to calculate the precise look angle relative to the baseline, permitting derivation of the surface topography. Expected statistical noise in the height measurements is on the order of 1 meter. In this contribution the design, measurement principles and characteristics of GAMMA's Portable Radar Interferometer (GPRI) are presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel automatic and$\backslash$n$\backslash$nunsupervised change-detection approach specifically oriented to$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe analysis of multitemporal single-channel single-polarization$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsynthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. This approach is based$\backslash$n$\backslash$non a closed-loop process made up of three main steps: 1) a novel$\backslash$n$\backslash$npreprocessing based on a controlled adaptive iterative filtering;$\backslash$n$\backslash$n2) a comparison between multitemporal images carried out according$\backslash$n$\backslash$nto a standard log-ratio operator; and 3) a novel approach$\backslash$n$\backslash$nto the automatic analysis of the log-ratio image for generating the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nchange-detection map. The first step aims at reducing the speckle$\backslash$n$\backslash$nnoise in a controlled way in order to maximize the discrimination$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncapability between changed and unchanged classes. In the second$\backslash$n$\backslash$nstep, the two filtered multitemporal images are compared to$\backslash$n$\backslash$ngenerate a log-ratio image that contains explicit information on$\backslash$n$\backslash$nchanged areas. The third step produces the change-detection map$\backslash$n$\backslash$naccording to a thresholding procedure based on a reformulation of$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe Kittler�Illingworth (KI) threshold selection criterion. In particular,$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe modified KI criterion is derived under the generalized$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGaussian assumption for modeling the distributions of changed$\backslash$n$\backslash$nand unchanged classes. This parametric model was chosen because$\backslash$n$\backslash$nit is capable of better fitting the conditional densities of classes$\backslash$n$\backslash$nin the log-ratio image. In order to control the filtering step and,$\backslash$n$\backslash$naccordingly, the effects of the filtering process on change-detection$\backslash$n$\backslash$naccuracy, we propose to identify automatically the optimal$\backslash$n$\backslash$nnumber of despeckling filter iterations [Step 1)] by analyzing the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nbehavior of the modified KI criterion. This results in a completely$\backslash$n$\backslash$nautomatic and self-consistent change-detection approach that$\backslash$n$\backslash$navoids the use of empirical methods for the selection of the best$\backslash$n$\backslash$nnumber of filtering iterations. Experiments carried out on two$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsets of multitemporal images (characterized by different levels$\backslash$n$\backslash$nof speckle noise) acquired by the European Remote Sensing 2$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsatellite SAR sensor confirm the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised$\backslash$n$\backslash$napproach, which results in change-detection accuracies$\backslash$n$\backslash$nvery similar to those that can be achieved by a manual supervised$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthresholding.},

abstract = {An effective algorithm for digital image noise filtering is presented in this paper. Mostnoise filtering techniques such as Kalman filter and transform domain methods require extensive image modeling and produce filtered images with considerable contrast loss. The algorithm proposed in this paper is an extension of Lee's local statistics method modified to utilize local gradient information. It does not require image modeling, and it will not smear edges and subtle details. For both the additive and multiplicative noise cases, the local mean and variance are computed from a reduced set of pixels depending on the orientation of the edge. Consequently, noise along the edge is removed, and the sharpness of the edge is enhanced. For practical applications when the noise variance is spatially varying and unknown, an adaptive filtering algorithm is developed. Experiments show its good potential for processing real-life images. Examples on images containing 256×256 pixels are given to substantiate the theoretical development.},

abstract = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used for Earth remote sensing for more than 30 years. It provides high-resolution, day-and-night and weather-independent images for a multitude of applications ranging from geoscience and climate change research, environmental and Earth system monitoring, 2-D and 3-D mapping, change detection, 4-D mapping (space and time), security-related applications up to planetary exploration. With the advances in radar technology and geo/bio-physical parameter inversion modeling in the 90s, using data from several airborne and spaceborne systems, a paradigm shift occurred from the development driven by the technology push to the user demand pull. Today, more than 15 spaceborne SAR systems are being operated for innumerous applications. This paper provides first a tutorial about the SAR principles and theory, followed by an overview of established techniques like polarimetry, interferometry and differential interferometry as well as of emerging techniques (e.g., polarimetric SAR interferometry, tomography and holographic tomography). Several application examples including the associated parameter inversion modeling are provided for each case. The paper also describes innovative technologies and concepts like digital beamforming, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and bi- and multi-static configurations which are suitable means to fulfill the increasing user requirements. The paper concludes with a vision for SAR remote sensing.},

abstract = {When working with multilook fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, an appropriate way of representing the backscattered signal consists of the so-called covariance matrix. For each pixel, this is a 3{\&}times;3 Hermitian positive definite matrix that follows a complex Wishart distribution. Based on this distribution, a test statistic for equality of two such matrices and an associated asymptotic probability for obtaining a smaller value of the test statistic are derived and applied successfully to change detection in polarimetric SAR data. In a case study, EMISAR L-band data from April 17, 1998 and May 20, 1998 covering agricultural fields near Foulum, Denmark are used. Multilook full covariance matrix data, azimuthal symmetric data, covariance matrix diagonal-only data, and horizontal-horizontal (HH), vertical-vertical (VV), or horizontal-vertical (HV) data alone can be used. If applied to HH, VV, or HV data alone, the derived test statistic reduces to the well-known gamma likelihood-ratio test statistic. The derived test statistic and the associated significance value can be applied as a line or edge detector in fully polarimetric SAR data also.},

abstract = {The polarization diversity of the phase causes ambiguities in the estimation of displacements using differential interferometry. Over natural surfaces such as vegetated areas, the magnitude of these ambiguities is potentially related to complex dynamic processes such as vegetation growth. As the properties and possible origins of such diversity (besides noiselike influences) over changing vegetation canopies are virtually unknown, we propose to investigate them empirically using an L-band zero-baseline data set covering one growing season over different agricultural crops. We frequently observe HH–VV phase differences exceeding 0.5$\pi$, corresponding to a displacement discrepancy of 3 cm. The HH–VV phase difference and other properties of the polarimetric coherence regions (e.g., the shape and the relation to the in situ observed biomass) vary with the crop type. The observations over wheat and barley and, to a lesser extent, rape suggest the presence of birefringence within the canopy. By contrast, those over maize and sugar beet, while also showing phase diversity, cannot be explained by birefringence or similarly simple models. Irrespective of the origin of this dependence, its presence and systematic nature indicate the potential importance of vegetation effects in differential interferometry, which may limit the accuracy of the estimated deformations over vegetated areas.},

@article{Freeman1992,
abstract = {Several different approaches to calibration of polarimetric radar image data have appeared recently in the literature. In particular, several papers by JPL authors have offered different perspectives on the polarimetric radar calibration problem. In this paper, we compare two of these approaches and demonstrate their functional equivalence. We show how one of the algorithms can be adapted to calibrate both scattering matrix and Stokes matrix format polarimetric radar data. Klein [1] has presented an approach for calibrating polarimetric SAR data in scattering matrix format, which relies on backscatter reciprocity and the lack of correlation between like- and cross-pol backscatter found in many natural targets. van Zyl [21 has presented an approach to the calibration of Stokes matrix (compressed) format polarimetric radar data, which is based on the assumption of reciprocity between the radar receive (R) and transmit (T) matrix representations. Both these approaches require one or more trihedral corner reflectors within the imaged scene. Freeman et al. [3] have presented an approach based on using three polarimetric active radar calibrators (PARC's) within the imaged scene. In general, techniques such as that described in [31, using three known (man-made) targets located at a single point will not be successful in calibrating all types of polarimetric radar data, because of the possibility of large variations in cross-talk amplitude and phase across the image swath. In this paper, we show that the assumptions about the backscatter and the polarimetric radar system for the two approaches described in Klein's and van Zyl's papers are equivalent. We demonstrate that, to first order in the radar system cross talk (i.e., neglecting terms of second order and above) an exact solution to the Stokes matrix format data calibration problem exists. We call this the first-order solution, for convenience. Next, we show that van Zyl's approach can give this first-order solution for appropriately symmetrized polarimetric radar data. Then we show how, if the data is properly symmetrized, van Zyl's approach can be used to calibrate both scattering matrix and Stokes matrix format data. These conclusions should be generally applicable to polarimetric imaging radar system data. The method is illustrated on NASA/JPL DC-8 SAR data and the results of calibrating in either scattering matrix or Stokes matrix format are shown to be in excellent agreement.},

abstract = {Outlet glaciers-which serve to drain ice from ice sheets-seem to be dynamically less stable in North Greenland than in South Greenland(1-3). Storstrommen, a large outlet glacier in northeastern Greenland which surged between 1978 and 1984 (ref. 2), has been well studied. In general, neither glacier surge mechanisms nor the geographical distribution of the surges are well known. Conventional satellite radar interferometry can provide large-scale topography models with high resolution(4), and can measure the radar line-of-sight component of ice-flow vector(5), but cannot map full vector flow fields, Here we present an interferometry method that combines observations from descending and ascending satellite orbits which, assuming ice flow parallel to the topographic surface, allows us to use the differing view angles to estimate full three-dimensional surface flow patterns, The accuracy of our technique is confirmed by the good agreement between our radar-based now model and in situ Global Positioning System (GPS) reference data at Storstrommen, Radar measurements such as these, made regularly and at high spatial density, have the potential to substantially enhance our understanding of glacier dynamics and ice-sheet flow, as well as improve the accuracy of glacier mass-balance estimates.},

abstract = {Standard focusing of data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) assumes a straight recording track of the sensor platform. Small nonlinearities of airborne platform tracks are corrected for during a motion-compensation step while maintaining the assumption of a linear flight path. This paper describes the processing of SAR data acquired from nonlinear tracks, typical of sensors mounted on small aircraft or drones flying at low altitude. Such aircraft do not fly along straight tracks, but the trajectory depends on topography, influences of weather and wind, or the shape of areas of interest such as rivers or traffic routes. Two potential approaches for processing SAR data from such highly nonlinear flight tracks are proposed, namely, a patchwise frequency-domain processing and mosaicking technique and a time-domain back-projection-based technique. Both are evaluated with the help of experimental data featuring tracks with altitude changes, a double bend, a 90deg curve, and a linear flight track. In order to assess the quality of the focused data, close-ups of amplitude images are compared, impulse response functions of a point target are analyzed, and the coherence is evaluated. The experimental data were acquired by the German Aerospace Center's E-SAR L-band system.},

@article{Navarro-Sanchez2014,
abstract = {Persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry (PSI) techniques are designed to measure ground deformations using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. They rely on the identification of pixels not severely affected by spatial or temporal decorrelation, which, in general, correspond to pointlike PSs commonly found in urban areas. However, in urban areas, we can find not only PSs but also distributed scatterers (DSs) whose phase information may be exploited for PSI applications. Estimation of DS parameters requires speckle filtering to be applied to the complex SAR data, but conventional speckle filtering approaches tend to mask PS information due to spatial averaging. In the context of single-polarization PSI, adaptive speckle filtering strategies based on the exploitation of amplitude temporal statistics have been proposed, which seek to avoid spatial filtering on nonhomogeneous areas. Given the growing interest on polarimetric PSI techniques, i.e., those using polarimetric diversity to increase performance over conventional single-polarization PSI, in this paper, we propose an adaptive spatial filter driven by polarimetric temporal statistics, rather than single-polarization amplitudes. The proposed approach is able to filter DS while preserving PS information. In addition, a new methodology for the joint processing of PS and DS in the context of PSI is introduced. The technique has been tested for two different urban data sets: 41 dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images of Murcia (Spain) and 31 full-polarization Radarsat-2 images of Barcelona (Spain). Results show an important improvement in terms of number of pixels with valid deformation information, hence denser area coverage.},

The principles of InSAR are introduced, taking care to clarify the limits and the potential of this technique for geomorphological studies. The application of InSAR to the quantification of landform attributes such as the slope and to the estimation of landform variations is investigated. Two case studies are presented. A first case study focuses on the problem of measuring landform attributes by interferometric SAR data. The interferometric result is compared with the corresponding one obtained by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In the second case study, the use of InSAR for the estimation of landform variations caused by a landslide is detailed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In strip-mode synthetic aperture imaging radar, the spatial resolution in range is given by a frequency-swept waveform, whereas the resolution in the orthogonal direction is derived from the record of phase as the beam footprint executes linear motion over the object. The combination of the laser and SAR processing techniques should pave the way for a higher resolution air borne or space borne remote sensor. Regarding the ladar transmitting FMCW signal, the motion during the transmission of a sweep and the reception of the corresponding echo wore expected to be one of the major problems. The given modified frequency scaling algorithm is taking the continuous motion into account, which can compensate for the Doppler shift induced by the continuous motion efficiently. And then, simulation of Phase screen (PS) distorted by atmospheric turbulence following the von Karman spectrum by using Fourier Transform is implemented in order to simulate turbulence. Finally, the computer simulation shows the validity of the modified algorithm and if in the turbulence the synthetic aperture length does not exceed the similar coherence length of the atmosphere for SAIL, we can ignore the effect of the turbulence.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the processing of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. Different approaches to deal with the temporal dimension of the data are considered, which are derived from different target characterizations in this dimension. These approaches are the basis for defining two different binary partition tree (BPT) structures that are employed for SAR polarimetry (PolSAR) data processing. Once constructed, the BPT is processed by a tree pruning, producing a set of spatiotemporal homogeneous regions, and estimating the polarimetric response within them. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique preserves the PolSAR information in the spatial and the temporal domains without introducing bias nor distortion. Additionally, the evolution of the data in the temporal dimension is also analyzed, and techniques to obtain BPT-based scene change maps are defined. Finally, the proposed techniques are employed to process two real RADARSAT-2 data sets.},

abstract = {Computational techniques involving contrast enhancement and noise filtering on two-dimensional image arrays are developed based on their local mean and variance. These algorithms are nonrecursive and do not require the use of any kind of transform. They share the same characteristics in that each pixel is processed independently. Consequently, this approach has an obvious advantage when used in real-time digital image processing applications and where a parallel processor can be used. For both the additive and multiplicative cases, the a priori mean and variance of each pixel is derived from its local mean and variance. Then, the minimum mean-square error estimator in its simplest form is applied to obtain the noise filtering algorithms. For multiplicative noise a statistical optimal linear approximation is made. Experimental results show that such an assumption yields a very effective filtering algorithm. Examples on images containing 256 × 256 pixels are given. Results show that in most cases the techniques developed in this paper are readily adaptable to real-time image processing.},

Our objective here is to demonstrate efficient solution for digital interpolation of RADARSAT-1 data in the range-Doppler domain. We implement data re-indexing by two-dimensional memory mapping for each phase of polyphase interpolation.

The paper discusses some features of FMCW radar which are not dealt with in much detail in the generally available literature. In particular, it discusses the effects of noise reflected back from the transmitter to the receiver and the application of moving target indication to FMCW radars. Some of the strengths and weaknesses of FMCW radar are considered. The paper describes how the strengths are utilised in some systems and how the weaknesses can be mitigated. It also discusses a modern implementation of a reflected power canceller, which can be used to suppress the leakage between the transmitter and the receiver, a well known problem with continuous wave radars},

abstract = { The performance of quantitative remote sensing based on multidimensional synthetic aperture radars (SARs), and polarimetric SAR systems in particular, depends strongly on a correct statistical characterization of the data, i.e., on a complete knowledge of the effects of the speckle noise. In this framework, the eigendecompostion of the covariance or coherency matrices and the associated{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\$}H/underlinealpha/A{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}decomposition have demonstrated the potential for quantitative estimation of physical parameters. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the statistics associated with this decomposition. This analysis requires the introduction of mathematical tools that are not well known in the remote sensing community. For this reason, we include a review section to present them. Using this work, we then present an expression for the probability density function of the sample eigenvalues of the covariance or coherency matrix. The availability of this expression allows a complete study of the separated sample eigenvalues, as well as, the entropy H and the anisotropy A. As demonstrated, all these parameters must be considered as asymptotically nonbiased with respect to the number of looks. In order to reduce the biases for a small number of averaged samples, a novel estimator for the eigenvalues is proposed. The results of this work are analyzed by means of simulated and real airborne SAR data. This analysis permits us to determine in detail the effects of the number of averaged samples in the estimation of physical information in radar polarimetry.},

abstract = {Proposes a new model for the inversion of surface roughness and soil moisture from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the polarimetric coherency matrix. It demonstrates how three polarimetric parameters, namely the scattering entropy (H), the scattering anisotropy (A), and the alpha angle ({\&}alpha;) may be used in order to decouple surface roughness from moisture content estimation offering the possibility of a straightforward inversion of these two surface parameters. The potential of the proposed inversion algorithm is investigated using fully polarimetric laboratory measurements as well as airborne L-band SAR data and ground measurements from two different test sites in Germany, the Elbe-Auen site and the Weiherbach site.},

@article{Galloway2007,
abstract = {The application of satellite differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry, principally coherent (InSAR) and to a lesser extent, persistent-scatterer (PSI) techniques to hydrogeologic studies has improved capabilities to map, monitor, analyze, and simulate groundwater flow, aquifer-system compaction and land subsidence. A number of investigations over the previous decade show how the spatially detailed images of ground displacements measured with InSAR have advanced hydrogeologic understanding, especially when a time series of images is used in conjunction with histories of changes in water levels and management practices. Important advances include: (1) identifying structural or lithostratigraphic boundaries (e.g. faults or transitional facies) of groundwater flow and deformation; (2) defining the material and hydraulic heterogeneity of deforming aquifer-systems; (3) estimating system properties (e.g. storage coefficients and hydraulic conductivities); and (4) constraining numerical models of groundwater flow, aquifer-system compaction, and land subsidence. As a component of an integrated approach to hydrogeologic monitoring and characterization of unconsolidated alluvial groundwater basins differential SAR interferometry contributes unique information that can facilitate improved management of groundwater resources. Future satellite SAR missions specifically designed for differential interferometry will enhance these contributions.},

abstract = {The CETP and Thomson-CSF have developed in 1992 a new polarimetric FM/CW X-band radar which has been designed to be easily mounted on small helicopter or aircraft. As it is devoted to research investigations on radar polarimetry applied to land and vegetation remote sensing, it needs to be calibrated in phase and amplitude with a very good accuracy. A calibration procedure using trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors is presented here and then compared to the calibration method using random distributed targets that has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A very good agreement between both methods enables us to apply our calibration algorithms to natural surfaces measurements at different incidence angles (20°, 40° and 50°).},

abstract = {Satellite radar interferometry (SRI) provides a sensitive means of monitoring the flow velocities and grounding-line positions of ice streams, which are indicators of response of the ice sheets to climatic change or internal instability. The detection limit is about 1.5 millimeters for vertical motions and about 4 millimeters for horizontal motions in the radar beam direction. The grounding line, detected by tidal motions where the ice goes afloat, can be mapped at a resolution of approximately 0.5 kilometer. The SRI velocities and grounding line of the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, agree fairly well with earlier ground-based data. The combined use of SRI and other satellite methods is expected to provide data that will enhance the understanding of ice stream mechanics and help make possible the prediction of ice sheet behavior.},

It makes no assumptions about$\backslash$nsystem reciprocity, permits ready interpretation of the terms in the$\backslash$ncalibration procedure, allows comparison of the relative magnitude of$\backslash$nthe system-induced mixing of terms in the observed covariance matrix, is$\backslash$nnoniterative, and produces indicators which allow testing of whether it$\backslash$nmeets its own underlying assumptions. The linear distortion model is$\backslash$nshown to lead to an inconsistent system of equations; this inconsistency$\backslash$ncan be removed by introducing an extra parameter which has properties$\backslash$nexpected of system noise.
