The method is conceived to provide angular information in range-based radar systems which do not allow mechanical or electronic beam steering. The beam steering is changed with frequency, which requires a novel scattered field data processing scheme/algorithm to recover the SAR image. System features, advantages and limitations are discussed, presenting simulation and measurement results, which show the system capabilities to resolve the range and angular position of the objects.},

The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

  abstract     = {We present spatially continuous velocity maps using repeat terrestrial radar interferometry (TRI) measurements to examine seasonal and diurnal dynamics of alpine glaciers at Mount Rainier, Washington. We show that the Nisqually and Emmons glaciers have small slope-parallel velocities near the summit (−1), high velocities over their upper and central regions (1.0–1.5 m day−1), and stagnant debris-covered regions near the terminus (−1). Velocity uncertainties are as low as ±0.02–0.08 m day−1. We document a large seasonal velocity decrease of 0.2–0.7 m day−1 (−25 to −50 {\%}) from July to November for most of the Nisqually glacier, excluding the icefall, suggesting significant seasonal subglacial water storage under most of the glacier. We did not detect diurnal variability above the noise level. Preliminary 2-D ice flow modeling using TRI velocities suggests that sliding accounts for roughly 91 and 99 {\%} of the July velocity field for the Emmons and Nisqually glaciers, respectively. We validate our observations against recent in situ velocity measurements and examine the long-term evolution of Nisqually glacier dynamics through comparisons with historical velocity data. This study shows that repeat TRI measurements with {\textgreater} 10 km range can be used to investigate spatial and temporal variability of alpine glacier dynamics over large areas, including hazardous and inaccessible areas.},

Different approaches to deal with the temporal dimension of the data are considered, which are derived from different target characterizations in this dimension. These approaches are the basis for defining two different binary partition tree (BPT) structures that are employed for SAR polarimetry (PolSAR) data processing. Once constructed, the BPT is processed by a tree pruning, producing a set of spatiotemporal homogeneous regions, and estimating the polarimetric response within them. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique preserves the PolSAR information in the spatial and the temporal domains without introducing bias nor distortion. Additionally, the evolution of the data in the temporal dimension is also analyzed, and techniques to obtain BPT-based scene change maps are defined. Finally, the proposed techniques are employed to process two real RADARSAT-2 data sets.},

Moreover, the system is not only capable of detecting the placement of the objects, but also their profile. In this sense, an imaging application showing the system capabilities for the detection of objects concealed under clothes is presented.

By exploiting the phase of the coherent radar signal, interferometry has transformed radar remote sensing from a largely interpretive science to a quantitative tool, with applications in cartography, geodesy, land cover characterization, and natural hazards.

It is designed for final-year undergraduates and master's students with limited background in linear algebra and calculus. Comprehensive and coherent, it develops everything from basic reasoning to advanced techniques within the framework of graphical models. Students learn more than a menu of techniques, they develop analytical and problem-solving skills that equip them for the real world. Numerous examples and exercises, both computer based and theoretical, are included in every chapter. Resources for students and instructors, including a MATLAB toolbox, are available online.},

This approach is based$\backslash$n$\backslash$non a closed-loop process made up of three main steps: 1) a novel$\backslash$n$\backslash$npreprocessing based on a controlled adaptive iterative filtering;$\backslash$n$\backslash$n2) a comparison between multitemporal images carried out according$\backslash$n$\backslash$nto a standard log-ratio operator; and 3) a novel approach$\backslash$n$\backslash$nto the automatic analysis of the log-ratio image for generating the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nchange-detection map. The first step aims at reducing the speckle$\backslash$n$\backslash$nnoise in a controlled way in order to maximize the discrimination$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncapability between changed and unchanged classes. In the second$\backslash$n$\backslash$nstep, the two filtered multitemporal images are compared to$\backslash$n$\backslash$ngenerate a log-ratio image that contains explicit information on$\backslash$n$\backslash$nchanged areas. The third step produces the change-detection map$\backslash$n$\backslash$naccording to a thresholding procedure based on a reformulation of$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe Kittler�Illingworth (KI) threshold selection criterion. In particular,$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthe modified KI criterion is derived under the generalized$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGaussian assumption for modeling the distributions of changed$\backslash$n$\backslash$nand unchanged classes. This parametric model was chosen because$\backslash$n$\backslash$nit is capable of better fitting the conditional densities of classes$\backslash$n$\backslash$nin the log-ratio image. In order to control the filtering step and,$\backslash$n$\backslash$naccordingly, the effects of the filtering process on change-detection$\backslash$n$\backslash$naccuracy, we propose to identify automatically the optimal$\backslash$n$\backslash$nnumber of despeckling filter iterations [Step 1)] by analyzing the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nbehavior of the modified KI criterion. This results in a completely$\backslash$n$\backslash$nautomatic and self-consistent change-detection approach that$\backslash$n$\backslash$navoids the use of empirical methods for the selection of the best$\backslash$n$\backslash$nnumber of filtering iterations. Experiments carried out on two$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsets of multitemporal images (characterized by different levels$\backslash$n$\backslash$nof speckle noise) acquired by the European Remote Sensing 2$\backslash$n$\backslash$nsatellite SAR sensor confirm the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised$\backslash$n$\backslash$napproach, which results in change-detection accuracies$\backslash$n$\backslash$nvery similar to those that can be achieved by a manual supervised$\backslash$n$\backslash$nthresholding.},

Berardino et al. (2001), which is mainly focused on investigating large scale deformations with spatial resolutions of about 100 m{\&}times;100 m. The proposed technique relies on small baseline differential SAR (DIFSAR) interferograms only, but it is implemented by using two different sets of data generated at low (multi-look data) and high spatial resolution (single-look data), respectively. The former are used to identify and estimate, via the SBAS technique or O. Mora et al. (2001, 2002), possible atmospheric phase artifacts and large scale deformation patterns; the latter to detect, on the high resolution residual phase components, structures highly coherent in time (buildings, rocks, lava structures, etc.), identified jointly to their heights and displacements. In particular the estimation of the temporal evolution of these local deformations is easily implemented by applying the SVD technique. The presented algorithm has been tested with data acquired by the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites relative to the Campania area (Italy).},

  Abstract                 = {A complete and detailed map of the ice-velocity field on mountain glaciers is obtained by cross-correlating SPOT5 optical images. This approach offers an alternative to SAR interferometry, because no present or planned RADAR satellite mission provides data with a temporal separation short enough to derive the displacements of glaciers. The methodology presented in this study does not require ground control points (GCPs). The key step is a precise relative orientation of the two images obtained by adjusting the stereo model of one "slave"' image assuming that the other "master" image is well georeferenced. It is performed with numerous precisely-located homologous points extracted automatically. The strong ablation occurring during summer time on the glaciers requires a correction to obtain unbiased displacements. The accuracy of our measurement is assessed based on a comparison with nearly simultaneous differential GPS surveys performed on two glaciers of the Mont Blanc area (Alps). If the images have similar incidence angles and correlate well, the accuracy is on the order of 0.5 m, or 1/5 of the pixel size. Similar results are also obtained without GCPs. An acceleration event, observed in early August for the Mer de Glace glacier, is interpreted in term of an increase in basal sliding. Our methodology, applied to SPOT5 images, can potentially be used to derive the displacements of the Earth's surface caused by landslides, earthquakes, and volcanoes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach to remote sensing of water vapor based on the global positioning system (GPS). Geodesists and geophysicists have devised methods for estimating the extent to which signals propagating from GPS satellites to ground-based GPS receivers are delayed by atmospheric water vapor. This delay is parameterized in terms of a time-varying zenith wet delay (ZWD) which is retrieved by stochastic filtering of the GPS data. Given surface temperature and pressure readings at the GPS receiver, the retrieved ZWD can be transformed with very little additional uncertainty into an estimate of the integrated water vapor (IWV) overlying that receiver. Networks of continuously operating GPS receivers are being constructed by geodesists, geophysicists, government and military agencies, and others in order to implement a wide range of positioning capabilities. These emerging GPS networks offer the possibility of observing the horizontal distribution of IWV or, equivalently, precipitable water with unprecedented coverage and a temporal resolution of the order of 10 min. These measurements could be utilized in operational weather forecasting and in fundamental research into atmospheric storm systems, the hydrologic cycle, atmospheric chemistry, and global climate change. Specially designed, dense GPS networks could be used to sense the vertical distribution of water vapor in their immediate vicinity. Data from ground-based GPS networks could be analyzed in concert with observations of GPS satellite occultations by GPS receivers in low Earth orbit to characterize the atmosphere at planetary scale.},

This causes phase of the range-compressed data to migrate over a large number of range-cells. Range-walk in the Doppler spectrum is compensated by interpolation in the range direction and re-indexing of data. Our objective here is to demonstrate efficient solution for digital interpolation of RADARSAT-1 data in the range-Doppler domain. We implement data re-indexing by two-dimensional memory mapping for each phase of polyphase interpolation. This makes correction for range-cell migration highly efficient, and parallel in terms of computation load. Results of accurate focusing in azimuth for the range-compressed point target response are presented in the paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Studies of interseismic strain accumulation are crucial to our understanding of continental deformation, the earthquake cycle and seismic hazard. By mapping small amounts of ground deformation over large spatial areas, InSAR has the potential to produce continental-scale maps of strain accumulation on active faults. However, most InSAR studies to date have focused on areas where the coherence is relatively good (e.g. California, Tibet and Turkey) and most analysis techniques (stacking, small baseline subset algorithm, permanent scatterers, etc.) only include information from pixels which are coherent throughout the time-span of the study. In some areas, such as Alaska, where the deformation rate is small and coherence very variable, it is necessary to include information from pixels which are coherent in some but not all interferograms. We use a three-stage iterative algorithm based on distributed scatterer interferometry. We validate our method using synthetic data created using realistic parameters from a test site on the Denali Fault, Alaska, and present a preliminary result of 10.5 ± 5.0 mmyr−1 for the slip rate on the Denali Fault based on a single track of radar data from ERS1/2.},

It is still a very good read though and certainly helped me enhance my knowledge of statistical analyses in R. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to examine spatial data in R, but there is a bit of homework to do to be able to understand how all the pieces fit together. Rating: 5 Just what is needed This book fills a gap in the Spatial Statistics literature. Most of the treatises are heavy on the math, and I find it difficult to bridge the gap between the formulas and applying them. The modules for R take care of this for you and leave you to interpret the result. This book covers most of these modules and demonstrates how to use them. Really worth getting. There is also the ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis Vol 2, but it is more of an introductory text. Rating: 5 Excelent Book! Do you know that felling you may have when you found exactly what you were looking for? Well, that was the felling I had when started to read this book. It brings detailed information about how you can and should use the spatial data analysis resources of R, with interactive examples and enlighten explanations. You will really understand what you are doing and will find ways to represent it the best way you could. Rating: 5 Lots of information, clearly presented. This is not a book for a beginner, but is an excellent book for two groups of readers: those who have some background with R and wish to learn about its capabilities for spatial statistics; and those with some background in spatial statistics who wish to learn how to use R. The authors have been the main developers of the spatial statistics packages on R, and therefore know the packages intimately. But the authors also have a deep knowledge of the spatial statistics literature, and I found myself learning something new about these methods in every chapter. Everyone serious about spatial statistics should see what R has to offer. This book is the easiest way to do that. Rating: 5 The best practial introduction to R spatial The R spatial packages are the leading edge for spatial analysis and spatial statistics. This book, by the primary developers of the R Spatial packages, is the best introduction to the subject that I have seen. Now, if you are comfortable with it, you can dive an and download R and R spatial and go to town. But if you need some help, this is a good place to start. This would also make a good textbook for a class on spatial analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper shows the potential applicability of orbital Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Differential Interferometry (DInSAR) with multiple images for terrain deformation episodes monitoring. This paper is focused on the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT) developed at the Remote Sensing Laboratory (RSLab) of the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC). CPT is able to extract from a stack of differential interferograms the deformation evolution over vast areas during wide spans of time. The former is achieved thanks to the coverage provided by current SAR satellites, like ESA's ERS or ENVISAT, while the latter due to the large archive of images acquired since 1992. An interferogram is formed by the complex product of two SAR images (one complex conjugate) and its phase contains information relative to topography, terrain deformation and atmospheric conditions among others. The goal of differential interferometric processing is to retrieve and separate the different contributions. The processing scheme is composed of three main steps: firstly, the generation of the best interferogram set among all the available images of the zone under study; secondly, the selection of the pixels with reliable phase within the employed interferograms and, thirdly, their phase analysis to calculate, as the main result, their deformation time series within the observation period. In this paper, the Coherent Pixels Technique (CPT) is presented in detail as well as the result of its application in different scenarios. Results reveal its practical utility for detecting and reproducing deformation episodes, providing a valuable tool to the scientific community for the understanding of considerable geological process and to monitor the impact of underground human activity.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive overview of the basic principles of radar polarimetry is presented. The relevant fundamental field equations are first provided. The importance of the propagation and scattering behavior in various frequency bands, the electrodynamic foundations such as Maxwell's equations, the Helmholtz vector wave equation and especially the fundamental laws of polarization will first be introduced: The fundamental terms which represent the polarization state will be introduced, defined and explained. Main points of view are the polarization Ellipse, the polarization ratio, the Stokes Parameter and the Stokes and Jones vector formalisms as well as its presentation on the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere and on relevant map projections. The Polarization Fork descriptor and the associated van Zyl polarimetric power density and Agrawal polarimetric phase correlation signatures will be introduced also in order to make understandable the polarization state formulations of electromagnetic waves in the frequency domain. The polarization state of electromagnetic waves under scattering conditions i.e. in the radar case will be described by matrix formalisms. Each scatterer is a polarization transformer; under normal conditions the transformation from the transmitted wave vector to the received wave vector is linear and this behavior, principally, will be described by a matrix called scattering matrix. This matrix contains all the information about the scattering process and the scatterer itself. The different relevant matrices, the respective terms like Jones Matrix, S-matrix, M{\"{u}}ller M-matrix, Kennaugh K- matrix, etc. and its interconnections will be defined and described together with change of polarization bases transformation operators, where upon the optimal (Characteristic) polarization states are determined for the coherent and partially coherent cases, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {We develop the theory of radar imaging from data measured by a moving antenna emitting a single-frequency waveform. We show that, under a linearized (Born) scattering model, the signal at a given Doppler shift is due to a superposition of returns from stationary scatterers on a cone whose axis is the flight velocity vector. This cone reduces to a hyperbola when the scatterers are known to lie on a planar surface. In this case, reconstruction of the scatterer locations can be accomplished by a tomographic inversion in which the scattering density function is reconstructed from its integrals over hyperbolas. We give an approximate reconstruction formula and analyse the resolution of the resulting image. We provide a numerical shortcut and show results of numerical tests in a simple case.},

  Abstract                 = {In 2004, the European Space Agency proposed a new Synthetic Aperture Radar mission, Wavemill, which would use new techniques to measure ocean height and ocean velocity down to 10 cm/s. Due to the high sampling frequency and the amount of data that would be produced, on-board processing would be necessary to more efficiently use the communication link, a link that would become a bottleneck if nothing was conducted on the data. An FPGA was recommended for performing the on-board processing. This thesis focuses on the implementation of a proposed SAR processor that will be used to process the raw SAR data inWavemill. The SAR processor was synthesized for a Xilinx Virtex-6 FPGA and simulation verified the design for the range compression component. The synthesis showed that implementation of the proposed real-time SAR processor was possible. The synthesis also showed that the SAR processor would function with a clock frequency of minimum 240 MHz.},

Fast scene acquisition in the order of 6 s/scene led to uniquely precise mapping of spatial and temporal variability of atmospheric phase delay. Observations led to a simple qualitative model for prediction of atmospheric disturbances using a simple model for solar radiation, which can be used for advanced campaign planning for short observation periods (hours to days).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a review of the current state of the art in the use of terrestrial radar interferometry for the detection of surface changes related to mass movement. Different hardware-types and acquisition concepts are described, which use either real or synthetic aperture for radar image formation. We present approaches for data processing procedures, paying special attention to the separation of high resolution displacement information from atmospheric phase variations. Recent case studies are used to illustrate applications in terrestrial radar interferometry for change detection. Applications range from detection and quantification of very slow moving (millimeters to centimeters per year) displacements in rock walls from repeat monitoring, to rapid processes resulting in fast displacements (50m/yr) acquired during single measurement campaigns with durations of only a few hours. Fast and episodic acting processes such as rockfall and snow avalanches can be assessed qualitatively in the spatial domain by mapping decorrelation caused by those processes. A concluding guide to best practice outlines the necessary preconditions that have to be fulfilled for successful application of the technique, as well as in areas characterized by rapid decorrelation. Empirical data from a Ku-band sensor show the range of temporal decorrelation of different surfaces after more than two years for rock-surfaces and after a few seconds to minutes in vegetated areas during windy conditions. The examples show that the displacement field can be measured for landslides in dense grassland, ice surfaces on flowing glaciers and snowpack creep. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {In early spring 2016 an exceptionally high rock-fall activity in a slope above the Village of Ghirone, Blenio-Valley Ticino, Switzerland was observed. Constant rock-fall activity was induced by toppling movement of the very thin-layered metamorphic rock. At this time, there was no information on the actual extent and the deformation rates of the landslide instability. Due to the rock-fall and failure related risk, no instrumentation on-site was possible. Local authorities then decided setting up a monitoring campaign using terrestrial radar interferometry that does not need installations in the target area. A campaign was started in the morning of 22 March 2016. Shortly after the beginning of the measurements, the extent of the active area could be determined, showing a total affected area of 5300 m2. The displacement velocity was in the range of 0.02--0.05 m/h, showing an increasing trend. Using inverse velocity extrapolations, a failure forecast could be done pointing to a potential failure event in the late afternoon of the same day. At 16:45 UTC+1 a major part of the slope failed. It was only 1/3 of the expected volume. Landslide activity continued and a second major failure was recorded in the night. The emergency campaign ended on 24 March 2016 after the deformation was decreasing to a level without imminent threat to the village. A refined post-processing of the radar data showed that the simplified real-time processing approach was suitable for the situation. Additionally, information on the 2d direction of the landslide movement could be obtained using intensity image pixel tracking technique. Finally, maps of volume differences could be created using the interferometric baseline, showing a difference of 33,900 m3 between 22 March and a later campaign performed on 31 May 2016.},

The main characteristic of the proposed model is to simultaneously use Dirac and Lebesgue measures at the class chain level. This allows the coexistence of hard pixels (obtained with the classical HMC segmentation) and fuzzy pixels (obtained with the fuzzy measure) in the same image. The quality assessment of the proposed method is achieved with several bidate sets of simulated images, and comparisons with classical HMC are also provided. Experimental results on real European Remote Sensing 2 Precision Image (ERS-2 PRI) images confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Interferometric combination of pairs of SAR images acquired by the European ERS-1 satellite maps deformation fields associated with two phenomena, both of small spatial extension and located in SE France: the one is rapid terrain deformation caused by a landslide near the city of Saint Etienne de Tinee, and the other is slower subsidence caused by underground coal mining near Gardanne. Unlike interferometric measurement of wide-field deformation, atmospheric propagation heterogeneity is not an accuracy-limiting factor. Although the radar data confirm prior knowledge concerning the landslide, such an application of SAR interferometry appears difficult under normal conditions of observation using current spaceborne radar systems. The study of soil subsidence, however, can be generalized and improves prior knowledge of the displacement field, which has here been modeled assuming elastic deformation in a half-space from several sources. The two examples help to understand the limits of the interferometric technique.},

The principles of InSAR are introduced, taking care to clarify the limits and the potential of this technique for geomorphological studies. The application of InSAR to the quantification of landform attributes such as the slope and to the estimation of landform variations is investigated. Two case studies are presented. A first case study focuses on the problem of measuring landform attributes by interferometric SAR data. The interferometric result is compared with the corresponding one obtained by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). In the second case study, the use of InSAR for the estimation of landform variations caused by a landslide is detailed. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this paper is to examine the applica- tion of single-baseline polarimetric SAR interferometry to the re- mote sensing and measurement of structure over forested terrain. For this, a polarimetric coherent scattering model for vegetation cover suitable for the estimation of forest parameters frominterfer- ometric observables is introduced, discussed and validated. Based on this model, an inversion algorithm which allows the estimation of forest parameters such as tree height, average extinction, and underlying topography from single-baseline fully polarimetric in- terferometric data is addressed. The performance of the inversion algorithm is demonstrated using fully polarimetric single baseline experimental data acquired by DLR's E-SAR system at L-band.},

The scattering entropy is a key parameter is determining the randomness in this model and is seen as a funda- mental parameter in assessing the importance of polarimetry in remote sensing problems.

  Abstract                 = {Spaceborne differential radar interferometry has proven a remarkable potential for mapping ground deformation phenomena (e.g., urban subsidence, volcano dynamics, coseismic and postseismic displacements along faults, as well as slope instability). However, a full operational capability has not been achieved yet due to atmospheric disturbances and phase decorrelation phenomena. These drawbacks can often be-at least partially-overcome by carrying out measurements on a subset of image pixels corresponding to natural or artificial stable reflectors [permanent scatterers (PS)] and exploiting long temporal series of interferometric data. This approach allows one to push the measurement precision very close to its theoretical limit (in the order of similar to1 mm for C-band European Remote Sensing (ERS)-like sensors). In this paper, the detection of both time-uniform and seasonal deformation phenomena is addressed, and a first assessment of the precision achievable by means of the PS Technique is discussed. Results highlighting deformation phenomena occurring in two test sites in California are reported (Fremont in the Southern Bay Area and San Jose in the Santa Clara Valley).},

  Abstract                 = {When working with multilook fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, an appropriate way of representing the backscattered signal consists of the so-called covariance matrix. For each pixel, this is a 3{\&}times;3 Hermitian positive definite matrix that follows a complex Wishart distribution. Based on this distribution, a test statistic for equality of two such matrices and an associated asymptotic probability for obtaining a smaller value of the test statistic are derived and applied successfully to change detection in polarimetric SAR data. In a case study, EMISAR L-band data from April 17, 1998 and May 20, 1998 covering agricultural fields near Foulum, Denmark are used. Multilook full covariance matrix data, azimuthal symmetric data, covariance matrix diagonal-only data, and horizontal-horizontal (HH), vertical-vertical (VV), or horizontal-vertical (HV) data alone can be used. If applied to HH, VV, or HV data alone, the derived test statistic reduces to the well-known gamma likelihood-ratio test statistic. The derived test statistic and the associated significance value can be applied as a line or edge detector in fully polarimetric SAR data also.},

Specifically, PSI is a radar-based technique that belongs to the group of differential interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). This paper provides a review of such PSI technique. It firstly recalls the basic principles of SAR interferometry, differential SAR interferometry and PSI. Then, a review of the main PSI algorithms proposed in the literature is provided, describing the main approaches and the most important works devoted to single aspects of PSI. A central part of this paper is devoted to the discussion of different characteristics and technical aspects of PSI, e.g. SAR data availability, maximum deformation rates, deformation time series, thermal expansion component of PSI observations, etc. The paper then goes through the most important PSI validation activities, which have provided valuable inputs for the PSI development and its acceptability at scientific, technical and commercial level. This is followed by a description of the main PSI applications developed in the last fifteen years. The paper concludes with a discussion of the main open PSI problems and the associated future research lines.},

Events triggered by cracks and icefalls were recorded, but no precise distinction between the two sources was possible using duration or frequency criteria. Clusters of seismic activity were located and confirmed by visual observations. We performed a surface motion analysis and found that surface motion was driven significantly by runoff changes at a timescale of 2–3 days. By means of a statistical analysis, a power-law behaviour of the released seismic energy distribution was discerned at certain times during the period investigated. Variations in power-law exponent values indicated that low- and high-energy events predominantly occurred during phases of enhanced and reduced surface motion, respectively. Substantial releases of seismic energy likely to signal the glacier recoupling were detected during phases of decreasing runoff. Clues to potential seismic precursors of break-off events are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent melting in Greenland and Antarctica has led to concerns about the long-term stability of these ice sheets and their potential contributions to future sea level rise. Marine-terminating outlet glaciers play a key role in the dynamics of these ice sheets; recent mass losses are likely related to increased influx of warmer water to the base of outlet glaciers, as evidenced by the fact that changes in ocean currents, calving front retreats, glacial thinning, mass redistribution based on satellite gravity data, and accelerating coastal uplift are roughly concurrent [e.g., Holland et al., 2008; Wouters et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 2010; Straneo et al., 2012; Bevis et al., 2012]. However, collecting quantitative measurements within the dynamic environment of marine outlet glaciers is challenging. Oceanographic measurements are limited in iceberg-laden fjords. Measuring ice flow speeds near the calving front is similarly challenging; satellite methods lack temporal resolution (satellite revisit times are several days or longer), while GPS gives limited spatial resolution, a problem for assessing changes near the highly variable calving front.},

A new feature of the software is the range-dependent spectral filtering to improve coherence in interferograms with long spatial baselines. Additional components include a module to estimate and remove digital elevation model errors before unwrapping, a mod- ule to mitigate the effects of the atmospheric phase delay and remove residual orbit errors, and a module to con- struct the phase change time series from small baseline interferograms (Berardino et al. 2002).

  Abstract                 = {Variations in the refractive index of the atmosphere cause variations in satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations. We can mitigate tropospheric effects by averaging N-independent interferograms. Because the neutral atmosphere is uncorrelated at timescales longer than 1 day, using this technique statistically reduces the variance, $\sigma$2, of the noise by a factor of N. Using zenith neutral atmospheric delays from Global Positioning System (GPS) data from the Southern California Integrated GPS Network, we find that the average variance depends on the distance between observations, L, and height difference, H, as $\sigma$ = c L$\alpha$ + kH with estimated values for c, $\alpha$, and k of about 2.5, 0.5, and 4.8, respectively, where $\sigma$ is in mm and L and H are in km. We expect that the value of $\alpha$ is largely site-independent but the value of c will depend on the water vapor variability of the area of interest. This model is valid over a range of L between approximately 10 and 800 km. Height differences between 0 and 3 km have been used in this analysis. For distances of 100 and 10 km with negligible height differences, $\sigma$ is estimated to be approximately 25 and 8 mm, respectively. For a given orbit revisit time and image archive duration, we calculate the number and duration (assumed constant) of interferograms required to achieve a desired sensitivity to deformation rate at a given length scale. Assuming neutral atmosphere is the dominant source of noise, a 30° look angle, and an image revisit time of 7 days, detection of a deformation rate of 1 mm yr−1 over distances of 10 km requires about 2.2 years of continuous observations. Given our results, we suggest a data covariance structure to use when using InSAR data to constrain geophysical models.},

In this paper, a new PolSAR change detector which makes use of Kullback-Leibler divergence is described. Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) measures the amount of information in common between coherent temporal multi-channel polarimetric SAR acquisitions. Although in this paper KL-divergence measure has analytically been derived for temporal polarimetric SAR images based on complex Wishart process in time, since the mathematical formulation is general, it can be implemented into any kind of multivariate remote sensing data such as multi-spectral optical and interferometric images. KL-divergence measure is also simplified to give an explicit expressions for temporal single channel SAR images. The new results are simple, easy to be used, and superior in providing detailed structure.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a new method for a measure of coherent similarity between temporal multichannel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and its implementation to change detection application. The method is based on mutual infor- mation (MI) from information theory. The MI measures the amount of information in common between coherent temporal multichannel SAR acquisitions. In order to develop an algo- rithm for all kinds of SAR images, such as interferometric SAR, polarimetric–interferometric SAR (PolInSAR), and partial PolIn- SAR, first, the joint density function of temporal multichannel images based on their second-order statistics has been derived. Then, the derived joint density function is used to calculate an analytical expression for the MI between temporal images, which is assumed to be maximal if the temporal images are identical. Although, in this paper, a new coherent similarity measure has analytically been derived for temporal polarimetric SAR images based on complexWishart process in time, since the mathematical formulation is general, it can equally well be implemented into any kind of multivariate remote sensing data, such as multispec- tral optical and interferometric images after small continuation. This derived quantity has been implemented for change detection application whose aim is to characterize the temporal behavior of the acquisitions. A comparison between the proposed and the other well-known change detection methods by means of scene characterization is shown, describing the advantages due to the fact that the proposed change detector involves almost every facet of applied change detection.},

  Abstract                 = {Avalanching glacier instabilities are gravity-driven rupture phenomena that might cause major disasters, especially when they are at the origin of a chain of processes. Reliably forecasting such events combined with a timely evacuation of endangered inhabited areas often constitute the most efficient action. Recently, considerable efforts in monitoring, analyzing, and modeling such phenomena have led to significant advances in destabilization process understanding, improving early warning perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent progress in this domain. Three different types of instabilities can be identified depending on the thermal properties of the ice/bed interface. If cold (1), the maturation of the rupture is associated with a typical time evolution of surface velocities and passive seismic activity. A prediction of the final break off is possible using these precursory signs. For the two other types, water plays a key role in the development of the instability. If the ice/bed interface is partly temperate (2), the presence of meltwater may reduce the basal resistance, which promotes the instability. No clear and easily detectable precursory signs are known in this case, and the only way to infer any potential instability is to monitor the temporal evolution of the thermal regime. The last type of instability (3) concerns steep temperate glacier tongues switching for several days/weeks during the melting season into a so-called “active phase” followed in rare cases by a major break-off event. Although the prediction of such events is still far from being achievable, critical conditions promoting the final instability can be identified.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1973, surface velocities were measured for the first time on an unstable hanging glacier to predict its collapse. The observed velocities have been shown to increase as a power-law function of time up to infinity at the theoretical time of failure (known as 'finite time singularity'). This is the characteristic signature of critical phenomena and has been observed in the case of various other naturally occurring ruptures such as earthquakes, landslides and snow avalanches. Recent velocity measurements performed on Weisshorn and M{\"{o}}nch hanging glaciers, Switzerland, confirmed this behaviour, while log-periodic oscillations superimposed on this general acceleration were also detected. Despite different rupture mechanisms in both cases, the log frequency of the oscillations is shown to be the same. The seismic activity was recorded near the unstable Weisshorn hanging glacier, simultaneously with the velocity measurements. Results show dramatically increasing icequake activity 3 days before the final collapse. Combined motion-seismic monitoring seems to be a promising way to accurately predict the breaking-off of hanging glaciers. Such a combined analysis is also useful for capturing the physical mechanisms of rupture in natural heterogeneous materials.},

  Abstract                 = {Permanent Scatterer SAR Interferometry (PSInSAR) aims to identify coherent radar targets exhibiting high phase stability over the entire observation time period. These targets often correspond to point-wise, man-made objects widely available over a city, but less present in non-urban areas. To overcome the limits of PSInSAR, analysis of interferometric data-stacks should aim at extracting geophysical parameters not only from point-wise deterministic objects (i.e., PS), but also from distributed scatterers (DS). Rather than developing hybrid processing chains where two or more algorithms are applied to the same data-stack, and results are then combined, in this paper we introduce a new approach, SqueeSAR, to jointly process PS and DS, taking into account their different statistical behavior. As it will be shown, PS and DS can be jointly processed without the need for significant changes to the traditional PSInSAR processing chain and without the need to unwrap hundreds of interferograms, provided that the coherence matrix associated with each DS is properly {\&}{\#}x201C;squeezed{\&}{\#}x201D; to provide a vector of optimum (wrapped) phase values. Results on real SAR data, acquired over an Alpine area, challenging for any InSAR analysis, confirm the effectiveness of this new approach.},

When, as it often happens, the dimension of the PS is smaller than the resolution cell, the coherence is good even for interferograms with baselines larger than the decorrelation one, and all the available images of the ESA ERS data set can be successfully exploited. On these pixels, submeter DEM accuracy and millimetric terrain motion detection can be achieved, since atmospheric phase screen (APS) contributions can be estimated and removed. Examples are then shown of small motion measurements, DEM refinement, and APS estimation and removal in the case of a sliding area in Ancona, Italy. ERS data have been used},

For this reason movement surveys were undertaken. The various surveying methods applied on the Weisshorn are outlined and the accuracy of the measurements is given. By least-square analysis different types of curves have been fitted to the data for velocity versus time. The best fit obtained so-far has been with hyperbolae. The confidence of extrapolations from such curves is discussed in relation to forecasts. By evaluating repeated photographs taken by an automatic camera from a single position, using a stereo plotter, the flow pattern has been established at the surface, part of the front, and one of the lateral faces of the ice mass. Changes with time caused by the deformation of the ice mass, the formation of crevasses and the crumbling away of the ice at the edge have been observed.},

In this paper, we present details of the UAVSAR radar performance, the radiometric calibration, and the polarimetric calibration. For the radiometric calibration, we employ an array of trihedral corner reflectors, as well as distributed targets. We show that UAVSAR is a well-calibrated SAR system for polarimetric applications, with absolute radiometric calibration bias better than 1 dB, residual root-mean-square (RMS) errors of {\~{}}0.7 dB, and RMS phase errors {\~{}}5.3{\&}{\#}x00B0;. For the polarimetric calibration, we have evaluated the methods of Quegan and Ainsworth et al. for crosstalk calibration and find that the method of Quegan gives crosstalk estimates that depend on target type, whereas the method of Ainsworth et al. gives more stable crosstalk estimates. We find that both methods estimate leakage of the copolarizations into the cross-polarizations to be on the order of -30 dB.},

  Abstract                 = {Several different approaches to calibration of polarimetric radar image data have appeared recently in the literature. In particular, several papers by JPL authors have offered different perspectives on the polarimetric radar calibration problem. In this paper, we compare two of these approaches and demonstrate their functional equivalence. We show how one of the algorithms can be adapted to calibrate both scattering matrix and Stokes matrix format polarimetric radar data. Klein [1] has presented an approach for calibrating polarimetric SAR data in scattering matrix format, which relies on backscatter reciprocity and the lack of correlation between like- and cross-pol backscatter found in many natural targets. van Zyl [21 has presented an approach to the calibration of Stokes matrix (compressed) format polarimetric radar data, which is based on the assumption of reciprocity between the radar receive (R) and transmit (T) matrix representations. Both these approaches require one or more trihedral corner reflectors within the imaged scene. Freeman et al. [3] have presented an approach based on using three polarimetric active radar calibrators (PARC's) within the imaged scene. In general, techniques such as that described in [31, using three known (man-made) targets located at a single point will not be successful in calibrating all types of polarimetric radar data, because of the possibility of large variations in cross-talk amplitude and phase across the image swath. In this paper, we show that the assumptions about the backscatter and the polarimetric radar system for the two approaches described in Klein's and van Zyl's papers are equivalent. We demonstrate that, to first order in the radar system cross talk (i.e., neglecting terms of second order and above) an exact solution to the Stokes matrix format data calibration problem exists. We call this the first-order solution, for convenience. Next, we show that van Zyl's approach can give this first-order solution for appropriately symmetrized polarimetric radar data. Then we show how, if the data is properly symmetrized, van Zyl's approach can be used to calibrate both scattering matrix and Stokes matrix format data. These conclusions should be generally applicable to polarimetric imaging radar system data. The method is illustrated on NASA/JPL DC-8 SAR data and the results of calibrating in either scattering matrix or Stokes matrix format are shown to be in excellent agreement.},

  Abstract                 = {Standard focusing of data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) assumes a straight recording track of the sensor platform. Small nonlinearities of airborne platform tracks are corrected for during a motion-compensation step while maintaining the assumption of a linear flight path. This paper describes the processing of SAR data acquired from nonlinear tracks, typical of sensors mounted on small aircraft or drones flying at low altitude. Such aircraft do not fly along straight tracks, but the trajectory depends on topography, influences of weather and wind, or the shape of areas of interest such as rivers or traffic routes. Two potential approaches for processing SAR data from such highly nonlinear flight tracks are proposed, namely, a patchwise frequency-domain processing and mosaicking technique and a time-domain back-projection-based technique. Both are evaluated with the help of experimental data featuring tracks with altitude changes, a double bend, a 90deg curve, and a linear flight track. In order to assess the quality of the focused data, close-ups of amplitude images are compared, impulse response functions of a point target are analyzed, and the coherence is evaluated. The experimental data were acquired by the German Aerospace Center's E-SAR L-band system.},

A number of investigations over the previous decade show how the spatially detailed images of ground displacements measured with InSAR have advanced hydrogeologic understanding, especially when a time series of images is used in conjunction with histories of changes in water levels and management practices. Important advances include: (1) identifying structural or lithostratigraphic boundaries (e.g. faults or transitional facies) of groundwater flow and deformation; (2) defining the material and hydraulic heterogeneity of deforming aquifer-systems; (3) estimating system properties (e.g. storage coefficients and hydraulic conductivities); and (4) constraining numerical models of groundwater flow, aquifer-system compaction, and land subsidence. As a component of an integrated approach to hydrogeologic monitoring and characterization of unconsolidated alluvial groundwater basins differential SAR interferometry contributes unique information that can facilitate improved management of groundwater resources. Future satellite SAR missions specifically designed for differential interferometry will enhance these contributions.},

  Abstract                 = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has great potential to detect and quantify land subsidence caused by aquifer system compaction. InSAR maps with high spatial detail and resolution of range displacement (+/-10 mm in change of land surface elevation) were developed for a groundwater basin (similar to 10(3) km(2)) in Antelope Valley, California, using radar data collected from the ERS-1. satellite. These data allow comprehensive comparison between recent (1993-1995) subsidence patterns and those detected historically (1926-1992) by more traditional methods. The changed subsidence patterns are generally compatible with recent shifts in land and water use. The InSAR-detected patterns are generally consistent with predictions based on a coupled model of groundwater flow and aquifer system compaction. The minor inconsistencies may reflect our imperfect knowledge of the distribution and properties of compressible sediments. When used in conjunction with coincident measurements of groundwater levels and other geologic information, InSAR data may be useful for constraining parameter estimates in simulations of aquifer system compaction.},

In this paper, we included space-time random effects in zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) and 'hurdle' models to investigate haulout patterns of harbor seals on glacial ice. The data consisted of counts, for 18 dates on a lattice grid of samples, of harbor seals hauled out on glacial ice in Disenchantment Bay, near Yakutat, Alaska. A hurdle model is similar to a ZIP model except it does not mix zeros from the binary and count processes. Both models can be used for zero-inflated data, and we compared space-time ZIP and hurdle models in a Bayesian hierarchical model. Space-time ZIP and hurdle models were constructed by using spatial conditional autoregressive (CAR) models and temporal first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) models as random effects in ZIP and hurdle regression models. We created maps of smoothed predictions for harbor seal counts based on ice density, other covariates, and spatio-temporal random effects. For both models predictions around the edges appeared to be positively biased. The linex loss function is an asymmetric loss function that penalizes overprediction more than underprediction, and we used it to correct for prediction bias to get the best map for space-time ZIP and hurdle models.},

The grounding line, detected by tidal motions where the ice goes afloat, can be mapped at a resolution of approximately 0.5 kilometer. The SRI velocities and grounding line of the Rutford Ice Stream, Antarctica, agree fairly well with earlier ground-based data. The combined use of SRI and other satellite methods is expected to provide data that will enhance the understanding of ice stream mechanics and help make possible the prediction of ice sheet behavior.},

  Abstract                 = {The small Baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometry (SBI) technique has been widely and successfully applied in various ground deformation monitoring applications. Over the last decade, a variety of SBI algorithms have been developed based on the same fundamental concepts. Recently developed SBI toolboxes provide an open environment for researchers to apply different SBI methods for various purposes. However, there has been no thorough discussion that compares the particular characteristics of different SBI methods and their corresponding performance in ground deformation reconstruction. Thus, two SBI toolboxes that implement a total of four SBI algorithms were selected for comparison. This study discusses and summarizes the main differences, pros and cons of these four SBI implementations, which could help users to choose a suitable SBI method for their specific application. The study focuses on exploring the suitability of each SBI module under various data set conditions, including small/large number of interferograms, the presence or absence of larger time gaps, urban/vegetation ground coverage, and temporally regular/irregular ground displacement with multiple spatial scales. Within this paper we discuss the corresponding theoretical background of each SBI method. We present a performance analysis of these SBI modules based on two real data sets characterized by different environmental and surface deformation conditions. The study shows that all four SBI processors are capable of generating similar ground deformation results when the data set has sufficient temporal sampling and a stable ground backscatter mechanism like urban area. Strengths and limitations of different SBI processors were analyzed based on data set configuration and environmental conditions and are summarized in this paper to guide future users of SBI techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a reliable technique for measuring crustal deformation. However, despite its long application in geophysical problems, its error estimation has been largely overlooked. Currently, the largest problem with InSAR is still the atmospheric propagation errors, which is why multitemporal interferometric techniques have been successfully developed using a series of interferograms. However, none of the standard multitemporal interferometric techniques, namely PS or SB (Persistent Scatterers and Small Baselines, respectively) provide an estimate of their precision. Here, we present a method to compute reliable estimates of the precision of the deformation time series. We implement it for the SB multitemporal interferometric technique (a favorable technique for natural terrains, the most usual target of geophysical applications). We describe the method that uses a properly weighted scheme that allows us to compute estimates for all interferogram pixels, enhanced by a Montecarlo resampling technique that properly propagates the interferogram errors (variance-covariances) into the unknown parameters (estimated errors for the displacements). We apply the multitemporal error estimation method to Lanzarote Island (Canary Islands), where no active magmatic activity has been reported in the last decades. We detect deformation around Timanfaya volcano (lengthening of line-of-sight ∼ subsidence), where the last eruption in 1730–1736 occurred. Deformation closely follows the surface temperature anomalies indicating that magma crystallization (cooling and contraction) of the 300-year shallow magmatic body under Timanfaya volcano is still ongoing.},

The target variable of the application is the daily mean PM10 concentration measured at rural air quality monitoring stations across Germany in 2005. R code for variogram fitting and interpolation is presented in this paper to illustrate the workflow of spatio-temporal interpolation using gstat.

  Abstract                 = {Velocities of the Filchner Ice Shelf and its tributary glaciers are derived using a variation of satellite radar interferometry known as speckle tracking. The method requires a coherent pair of SAR passes, a digital elevation model and, for floating ice, an estimate of the height if difference due to the tide. Speckle tracking interferometry has the advantage that ice speed and direction can be estimated from one interferometric pair and, with adequate coherence, it is suitable for areas of high velocity and long repeat cycles. Fluxes are estimated using the ice velocities together with ice thickness data derived from a hydrostatic equilibrium model. They are given for gates downstream from the grounding lines of the input tributary glaciers, and for a gate close to the ice shelf edge. The calculations show that the flux close to the edge of the Filchner Ice Shelf (similar to 75.3 km(3)/a) is comparable to that estimated further upstream. However the errors in the estimates (similar to 10 km(3)/a) preclude any firm conclusions concerning equilibrium of the ice shelf or bottom surface melt or accretion. Assuming the upstream fluxes reflect the flow across the grounding lines, then the Recovery Glacier is the largest contributor to the ice shelf with 48{\%} and the Slessor Glacier is the second largest with 33{\%}. Support Force Glacier and Foundation Ice Stream both contribute similar to7{\%}. Ice Shelf accumulation accounts for the remaining 5{\%}.},

  Abstract                 = {In strip-mode synthetic aperture imaging radar, the spatial resolution in range is given by a frequency-swept waveform, whereas the resolution in the orthogonal direction is derived from the record of phase as the beam footprint executes linear motion over the object. The combination of the laser and SAR processing techniques should pave the way for a higher resolution air borne or space borne remote sensor. Regarding the ladar transmitting FMCW signal, the motion during the transmission of a sweep and the reception of the corresponding echo wore expected to be one of the major problems. The given modified frequency scaling algorithm is taking the continuous motion into account, which can compensate for the Doppler shift induced by the continuous motion efficiently. And then, simulation of Phase screen (PS) distorted by atmospheric turbulence following the von Karman spectrum by using Fourier Transform is implemented in order to simulate turbulence. Finally, the computer simulation shows the validity of the modified algorithm and if in the turbulence the synthetic aperture length does not exceed the similar coherence length of the atmosphere for SAIL, we can ignore the effect of the turbulence.},

  Abstract                 = {The classical point measurement methods for, soil moisture content and surface roughness, are described. The ground data acquisition as well as the SAR data acquisition campaign were performed with the E-SAR of the German Aerospace Center at Oberpfaffenhofen (DLR-OP- IHR) over two test sites in Germany, the Elbe-Auen and the Weiherbach region. The basic principles of SAR and radar polarimetry are introduced in order to provide the conceptual framework for the inversion of surface parameters from fully polarimetric SAR data, which includes the critical assessment of various novel polarimetric concepts. The prevalent methods for estimating the surface parameters from polarimetric SAR data are critically reviewed. The small perturbation model and two semi-empirical models are forming the basis of a comparative analysis. These two semi-empirical models were chosen in order to provide an overview of the evolution of ideas and techniques in the area of quantitative surface parameter estimation utilising partially polarimetric SAR image data takes. Further, the potential of polarimetric techniques recently developed in different application areas are investigated with regard to their suitability to improve the performance of the introduced inversion algorithms. First, the potential for applying the polarimetric decomposition techniques was addressed in order to repress the disturbing influence of secondary scattering processes, resulting from rough surface scatter. Then, the potential to estimate terrain slopes from fully polarimetric data utilising polarimetric techniques only is investigated and discussed as an attractive alternative to the standard method of using a-priori terrain information. A new model for the inversion of surface parameters from polarimetric SAR image data takes, the Extended Bragg Model, is introduced. The main advantages and disadvantages of this alternate model are discussed. Finally, future perspectives on how to extend the model by implementation of recent advances in polarimetric SAR interferometry are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The traveling-wave slot antenna is similar to a traveling-wave wire antenna, but it is far more versatile because the phase velocity and rate of radiation of the fields in the antenna can be controlled. Four types of traveling-wave slot antennas have been identified. These are: (a) the conventional transverse electric, TE (no tangential E field parallel to the slot length); (b) transverse magnetic, TM (no tangential H field parallel to the slot length); (c) a hybrid with negligible transverse E, and (d) a hybrid with negligible normal H. Only the hybrid types are capable of producing maximum radiation in the direction of the slot axis (i. e., end-fire radiation). The complex propagation constant which is characteristic of uniform traveling-wave slots has been measured for a variety of waveguide geometries and is presented in the form of graphs. The radiation pattern of a traveling-wave slot can be controlled to give low side lobe or "cosecant squared" type patterns by appropriate variation of slot width with distance z along the axis. An approximate formula for the variation of attenuation {\^{A}}¿ with z required to give a specified pattern can be derived. This in turn gives the required variation of slot width with z. An examination of the principle of superposition shows that the conventional technique of array design is an approximation which has proved inadequate in the design of certain slot arrays.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we introduce an iterative speckle filtering method for polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images based on the bilateral filter. To locally adapt to the spatial structure of images, this filter relies on pixel similarities in both spatial and radiometric domains. To deal with polarimetric data, we study the use of similarities based on a statistical distance called Kullback-Leibler divergence as well as two geodesic distances on Riemannian manifolds. To cope with speckle, we propose to progressively refine the result thanks to an iterative scheme. Experiments are run over synthetic and experimental data. First, simulations are generated to study the effects of filtering parameters in terms of polarimetric reconstruction error, edge preservation and smoothing of homogeneous areas. Comparison with other methods shows that our approach compares well to other state of the art methods in the extraction of polarimetric information and shows superior performance for edge restoration and noise smoothing. The filter is then applied to experimental data sets from ESAR and FSAR sensors (DLR) at L-band and S-band, respectively. These last experiments show the ability of the filter to restore structures such as buildings and roads and to preserve boundaries between regions while achieving a high amount of smoothing in homogeneous areas.},

A compensation approach based on the available on-site meteo parameters (pressure, temperature, and humidity) is then investigated. The technique proposes an initial calibration step on humidity which leads to significant improvements in the APS removal. The results of the technique are discussed in the case of a real campaign data set (Bolzano, Italy) that covers a temporal baseline of about one week.},

The method presented represents an extension of already existing techniques, but now taking into account the effect of steep topography in the atmospheric phase screen compensation process. In addition, the technique is adapted to work with polarimetric SAR data, showing, in that case, a noticeable improvement in the compensation process. The method is validated in the mountainous environment of El Forn de Canillo, located in the Andorran Pyrenees, where there is a slow-moving landslide that nowadays is being reactivated coinciding with strong rain episodes. In this framework, ten zero-baseline fully polarimetric data sets have been acquired at X-band during a one-year measurement campaign (October 2010–October 2011) with the GB-SAR sensor developed at the Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya. First, the impact of the severe atmospheric fluctuations among multitemporal GB-SAR measurements is carefully studied and analyzed. Hence, the need to correctly estimate and compensate the resulting phase differences when retrieving interferometric information is put forward in the frame of differential-SAR-interferometry applications.},

Historically, DInSAR techniques have been limited to the single-polarimetric case, mainly due to the unavailability of fully polarimetric data. Lately, the launch of satellites with polarimetric capabilities, such as the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), RADARSAT-2, or TerraSAR-X, allowed merging polarimetric and interferometric techniques to improve the pixels' phase quality and, thus, the density and the reliability of the final DInSAR results. The relationship between the polarimetrically optimized coherence or amplitude dispersion maps and the final DInSAR results is carefully analyzed, using both orbital and ground-based SAR fully polarimetric data. DInSAR processing using polarimetric optimization techniques in the pixel selection process is compared with the classical single-polarimetric approach, achieving up to a threefold increase of the number of pixel candidates in the coherence case and up to a factor of seven in the amplitude dispersion case.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the hydrological dynamics of boreal wetland ecosystems (peatlands) is essential in order to better manage hydropower inter-annual productivity at the La Grande basin (Northern Quebec, QC, Canada). Given the remoteness and the huge dimension of the La Grande basin, it is imperative to develop remote sensing monitoring techniques to retrieve hydrological parameters. The main objective of this study is to find out if multi-date and multi-polarization Radar Satellite 2 (RADARSAT-2) (C-band) image analysis could detect seasonal variations of surface soil moisture conditions of the acrotelm. A change detection approach through the use of multi temporal indexes was chosen based on the assumption that the temporal variability of surface roughness and natural vegetation biomass is generally at a much longer time scale than that of surface soil moisture ($\Delta$-Index is based on a reference image that represents dry soil, in order to maximize the sensitivity of $\sigma$° to changes in soil moisture with respect to the same location when soil is wet). The $\Delta$-Index approach was tested with each polarization: $\sigma$° for fully polarimetric mode (HH, HV, VV) and the cross-polarization coefficient (HV/HH). Results show that the best regression adjustment with regard to surface soil moisture content in boreal wetlands was obtained with the cross-polarization coefficient. The cross-polarization multi-temporal index enables precise volumetric surface soil moisture estimation and monitoring on boreal wetlands, regardless of the influence of vegetation cover and surface roughness conditions (bias was under 1{\%}, standard deviation and RMSE were under 10{\%} for almost all estimation errors). Surface soil moisture estimation was more precise over permanently flooded areas than seasonally flooded ones (standard deviation is systematically greater for the seasonally flooded areas, at all analyzed scales), although the overall quality of the estimation is still precise.

  Abstract                 = {Despite remarkable successes achieved by Differential InSAR, estimations of low tectonic strain rates remain challenging in areas where deformation and topography are correlated, mainly because of the topography-related atmospheric phase screen (APS). In areas of high relief, empirical removal of the stratified component of the APS may lead to biased estimations of tectonic deformation rates. Here we describe a method to correct interferograms from the effects of the spatial and temporal variations in tropospheric stratification by computing tropospheric delay maps coincident with SAR acquisitions using the ERA-Interim global meteorological model. The modeled phase delay is integrated along vertical profiles at the ERA-I grid nodes and interpolated at the spatial sampling of the interferograms above the elevation of each image pixel. This approach is validated on unwrapped interferograms. We show that the removal of the atmospheric signal before phase unwrapping reduces the risk of unwrapping errors in areas of rough topography.},

  Abstract                 = {Interferometric synthetic aperture radar data are used to map the interseismic velocity field along the Haiyuan fault system (HFS), at the north-eastern boundary of the Tibetan plateau. Two M ∼ 8 earthquakes ruptured the HFS in 1920 and 1927, but its 260 km-long central section, known as the Tianzhu seismic gap, remains unbroken since ∼1000 years. The Envisat SAR data, spanning the 2003–2009 period, cover about 200 × 300 km2 along three descending and two ascending tracks. Interferograms are processed using an adapted version of ROI{\_}PAC. The signal due to stratified atmospheric phase delay is empirically corrected together with orbital residuals. Mean line-of-sight velocity maps are computed using a constrained time series analysis after selection of interferograms with low atmospheric noise. These maps show a dominant left-lateral motion across the HFS, and reveal a narrow, 35 km-long zone of high velocity gradient across the fault in between the Tianzhu gap and the 1920 rupture. We model the observed velocity field using a discretized fault creeping at shallow depth and a least squares inversion. The inferred shallow slip rate distribution reveals aseismic slip in between two fully locked segments. The average creep rate is ∼5 mm yr−1, comparable in magnitude with the estimated loading rate at depth, suggesting no strain accumulation on this segment. The modeled creep rate locally exceeds the long term rate, reaching 8 mm yr−1, suggesting transient creep episodes. The present study emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring of the surface velocity in the vicinity of major seismic gaps in terms of seismic hazard assessment.},

Several simulations are used to assess baseline accuracy in terms of tie-point error and the number and distribution of tie points. These results give insight into how best to select tie points, and also demonstrate the level of accuracy that can be achieved. Examination of two representative cases likely to occur in mapping ice-sheet motion leads to the conclusion that with adequate tie-point information ice velocity can be measured accurately to within a few meters per year. A method to correct horizontal velocity estimates for the effect of vertical displacement using surface slopes is also developed. Finally, we estimate the single-component velocity field for an area on Humboldt Glacier, northern Greenland, using interferograms formed from ERS-1 SAR image.

  Abstract                 = {High mountains represent one of the most dynamic environments on earth. Monitoring their terrain changes is necessary to understand mass-transport systems, to detect related environmental variability, and to assess natural hazards. Here, we apply standard software to automatically generate digital elevation models (DEM) from aerial photography and Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite stereo imagery. By comparison to a photogrammetrically derived DEM, an accuracy of ± 60 m RMS of the ASTER DEM was found for rough high-mountain topography, and ± 18 m RMS for moderately mountainous terrain. Differences between multi-temporal DEMs are used to determine vertical terrain changes. Horizontal movements are computed from multi-temporal orthoimages. The techniques are applied for three case studies. (1) The flow-field of Tasman glacier, New Zealand, as measured from ASTER data, showed glacier speeds of up to 250 m per year and a surprising minimum speed in the middle of the glacier. (2) The velocity-field of creeping mountain permafrost in Val Muragl, Swiss Alps, with speeds of up to 0.5 m per year was determined with high resolution from aerial stereo imagery and provided new insights in the spatial coherence of permafrost creep. (3) Deformations of up to 0.1 m per year on a large landslide near Aletsch glacier, Swiss Alps, could be detected. As a rule of thumb, we estimate the achieved accuracy for elevation changes and horizontal displacements to approximate the size of one image pixel, i.e. 15 m for ASTER and 0.2-0.3 m for the here-used aerial photography. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  Abstract                 = {Process interactions and chain reactions, the present shift of cryospheric hazard zones due to atmospheric warming, and the potential far reach of glacier disastersmake it necessary to apply modern remote sensing techniques for the assessment of glacier and permafrost hazards in high mountains. Typically, related hazard source areas are situ-ated in remote regions, often difficult to access for physical and/or political reasons. In this contribution we provide an overview of air- and spaceborne remote sensing methods suitable for glacier and permafrost hazard assessment and disaster management. A number of image classification and change detection techniques support high-mountain hazard studies. Digital terrain models (DTMs), derived from optical stereo data, synthetic aperture radar or laserscanning, represent one of the most important data sets for investigating high-mountain processes. Fusion of satellite stereo-derived DTMs with the DTM from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is a promising way to combine the advantages of both technologies. Large changes in terrain volume such as from avalanche deposits can indeed be measured even by repeat satellite DTMs. Multitemporal data can be used to derive surface displacements on glaciers, permafrost and landslides. Combining DTMs, results from spectral image classification, and multitemporal data from change detection and displacement measurements significantly improves the detection of hazard potentials. Modelling of hazardous processes based on geographic information systems (GIS) complements the remote sensing analyses towards an integrated assessment of glacier and permafrost hazards in mountains. Major present limitations in the application of remote sensing to glacier and permafrost hazards in mountains are, on the one hand, of technical nature (e.g. combination and fusion of different methods and data; improved understanding of microwave backscatter). On the other hand, better dissemination of remote sensing expertise towards institutions involved in high-mountain hazard assessment and management is needed in order to exploit the large potential of remote sensing in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {The classical filtering and prediction problem is re-examined using the Bode- Shannon representation of random processes and the state transition method of analysis of dynamic systems. New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite- memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co- efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

  Abstract                 = {Many colour maps provided by vendors have highly uneven perceptual contrast over their range. It is not uncommon for colour maps to have perceptual flat spots that can hide a feature as large as one tenth of the total data range. Colour maps may also have perceptual discontinuities that induce the appearance of false features. Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an overview of the Differential SAR Interferometry algorithm referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) technique, that allows us to detect surface deformation and to analyze their space-time characteristics. Following the description of the main theoretical aspects of the algorithm, we present several results obtained by applying the SBAS approach in selected case studies relevant to phenomena affecting volcanic areas (Campi Flegrei caldera and Somma-Vesuvio complex, Italy), aquifers (Santa Clara area within the San Francisco bay, California) and landslides (Maratea Valley, Italy). The overall analysis is carried out by using multilook DInSAR interferograms with a spatial resolution of the order of 100 × 100 m, computed from SAR data acquired by the ERS-1 and ERS-2 sensors. In particular, we highlight the peculiarities of the SBAS technique and its surface deformation retrieval capability for what concerns both large-scale deformation phenomena and more localized displacement effects. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, Basel, 2007.},

  Abstract                 = {The CETP and Thomson-CSF have developed in 1992 a new polarimetric FM/CW X-band radar which has been designed to be easily mounted on small helicopter or aircraft. As it is devoted to research investigations on radar polarimetry applied to land and vegetation remote sensing, it needs to be calibrated in phase and amplitude with a very good accuracy. A calibration procedure using trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors is presented here and then compared to the calibration method using random distributed targets that has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A very good agreement between both methods enables us to apply our calibration algorithms to natural surfaces measurements at different incidence angles (20°, 40° and 50°).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data$\backslash$ncorrection for changes in radar cross sections, which are caused by$\backslash$nazimuth slopes. Most radiometric slope corrections remove slope effects$\backslash$nto account for the effective scattering pixel area. However, few studies$\backslash$naddress the slope effect on the radar cross section as a function of$\backslash$npolarization states. The authors propose two approaches to compensate$\backslash$nfor this azimuth slope effect for POLSAR data. In the first approach,$\backslash$nthe digital elevation model (DEM), obtained from interferometric SAR or$\backslash$nfrom other means, is used to estimate orientation angles, and in the$\backslash$nsecond approach, orientation angles are derived directly from the POLSAR$\backslash$ndata. They have developed three new methods to implement this second$\backslash$napproach. One is based on the right-right and left-left circular$\backslash$npolarizations, and the other two are based on Cloude's and Huynelt's$\backslash$ndecompositions. The results are compared with the original polarization$\backslash$nsignature method using the DEM-generated orientation angles as the$\backslash$nreference. POLSAR data is then compensated using the derived orientation$\backslash$nangles. Significant changes were observed in many elements of the$\backslash$ncoherency matrix. The compensated POLSAR data should improve the$\backslash$naccuracy of geophysical parameter estimation techniques. NASA/JPL AIRSAR$\backslash$ndata for an area in central California is used for illustration},

  Abstract                 = {An effective algorithm for digital image noise filtering is presented in this paper. Mostnoise filtering techniques such as Kalman filter and transform domain methods require extensive image modeling and produce filtered images with considerable contrast loss. The algorithm proposed in this paper is an extension of Lee's local statistics method modified to utilize local gradient information. It does not require image modeling, and it will not smear edges and subtle details. For both the additive and multiplicative noise cases, the local mean and variance are computed from a reduced set of pixels depending on the orientation of the edge. Consequently, noise along the edge is removed, and the sharpness of the edge is enhanced. For practical applications when the noise variance is spatially varying and unknown, an adaptive filtering algorithm is developed. Experiments show its good potential for processing real-life images. Examples on images containing 256×256 pixels are given to substantiate the theoretical development.},

These algorithms are nonrecursive and do not require the use of any kind of transform. They share the same characteristics in that each pixel is processed independently. Consequently, this approach has an obvious advantage when used in real-time digital image processing applications and where a parallel processor can be used. For both the additive and multiplicative cases, the a priori mean and variance of each pixel is derived from its local mean and variance. Then, the minimum mean-square error estimator in its simplest form is applied to obtain the noise filtering algorithms. For multiplicative noise a statistical optimal linear approximation is made. Experimental results show that such an assumption yields a very effective filtering algorithm. Examples on images containing 256 × 256 pixels are given. Results show that in most cases the techniques developed in this paper are readily adaptable to real-time image processing.},

This algorithm can also be applied to multi-frequency multi-look polarimetric SAR data, as well as to SAR data containing only intensity information. A procedure is then developed for unsupervised classification. The classification error is assessed by using Monte Carlo simulation of multi-look polarimetric SAR data, owing to the lack of ground truth for each pixel. Comparisons of classification errors using the training sets and single-look data are also made. Applications of this algorithm are demonstrated with NASA/JPL P-, L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data.},

  Abstract                 = {A ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) interferometer is used to retrieve the velocity field of a landslide. High-resolution images are obtained by means of a time domain SAR processor. An in-depth analysis of the sequence of SAR interferograms enables the recognition of a slowly deforming upper scarp in the scene, and a debris flow that feeds the accumulation zone of the landslide, where a fast change in terrain morphology is observed. The estimated deformation map is in agreement with the available measurements obtained by means of Global Positioning System receivers. Results show that GB-SAR interferometry is a cost-effective solution for the monitoring of landslides. The proposed method is shown to be a valid complement to space- and airborne SAR and to the traditional geodetic instruments.},

  Abstract                 = {Moist air is characterized for the frequency range 1–1000 GHz as a nonturbulent propagation medium described by meteorological parameters. An adequate spectroscopic data base for air consists of three terms: (1) resonance information for 29 H2O lines up to 1097 GHz and 44 O2 lines up to 834 GHz in the form of intensity coefficients and center frequency for each line; (2) an empirical water vapor continuum spectrum; and (3) a liquid water attenuation term for haze and cloud conditions. This data base is the heart of two computer programs which calculate and plot attenuation rates (in decibels per kilometer), refractivity (in parts per million), and refractive dispersion (in parts per million). The first covers the troposphere and requires pressure, temperature, and relative humidity as input data. The second addresses isolated line behavior in the mesosphere wherein the geomagnetic field strength H is an additional input parameter due to the Zeeman effect of the O2 molecules. Each oxygen line splits proportionally with H into numerous sublines, which are juxtaposed to form Zeeman patterns spread over a megahertz scale. Patterns of three main polarization cases are considered. Various typical examples for a model atmosphere demonstrate the utility of the approach, provide new information, and underline the serious role that water vapor plays above 120 GHz.},

  Abstract                 = { The performance of quantitative remote sensing based on multidimensional synthetic aperture radars (SARs), and polarimetric SAR systems in particular, depends strongly on a correct statistical characterization of the data, i.e., on a complete knowledge of the effects of the speckle noise. In this framework, the eigendecompostion of the covariance or coherency matrices and the associated{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\$}H/underlinealpha/A{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}decomposition have demonstrated the potential for quantitative estimation of physical parameters. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the statistics associated with this decomposition. This analysis requires the introduction of mathematical tools that are not well known in the remote sensing community. For this reason, we include a review section to present them. Using this work, we then present an expression for the probability density function of the sample eigenvalues of the covariance or coherency matrix. The availability of this expression allows a complete study of the separated sample eigenvalues, as well as, the entropy H and the anisotropy A. As demonstrated, all these parameters must be considered as asymptotically nonbiased with respect to the number of looks. In order to reduce the biases for a small number of averaged samples, a novel estimator for the eigenvalues is proposed. The results of this work are analyzed by means of simulated and real airborne SAR data. This analysis permits us to determine in detail the effects of the number of averaged samples in the estimation of physical information in radar polarimetry.},

In certain cases it is desirable to limit the number of spatial (along-track) domain samples acquired in a SAR radar because of external constraints on sampling frequency or on the overall number of samples - e.g. in order to economy on time or power consumed. Lowering number of samples taken may, however, lead to spatial aliasing and incorrect reconstruction of the image. Nonuniform sampling allows to reduce the aliasing effect and reconstruct the image better. This technique can be applied with standard reconstruction methods, but it works best together with Compressive Sensing reconstruction algorithms. The idea will be verified with an experimental noise SAR built at ISE PW.},

  Abstract                 = {Target detectors using polarimetry are often focused on single targets, since these can be characterized in a simpler and deterministic way. The algorithm proposed in this paper is aimed at the more difficult problem of partial-target detection (i.e., targets with arbitrary degree of polarization). The authors have already proposed a single-target detector employing filters based on a geometrical perturbation. In order to enhance the algorithm to the detection of partial targets, a new vector formalism is introduced. The latter is similar to the one exploited for single targets but suitable for complete characterization of partial targets. A new feature vector is generated starting from the covariance matrix and exploited for the perturbation method. Validation against L-band fully polarimetric airborne E-SAR and ALOS PALSAR data and X-band dual-polarimetric TerraSAR-X data is provided with significant agreement with the expected results. Additionally, a comparison with the supervised Wishart classifier is presented revealing improvements.},

  Abstract                 = {GROUND-BASED measurements of volcano deformation can be used to assess eruptive hazard, but require the costly (and often hazardous) installation and maintenance of an instrument network, Here we show that spaceborne radar interferometry, which has already shown its utility in mapping earthquake-related deformation(1), can be used to monitor long-term volcano deformation. Two families of synthetic aperture radar images, acquired from ascending and descending orbits by the satellite ERS-1, and looking at Mount Etna from opposite sides, cover the time period from 17 May 1992 to 24 October 1993, and include the second half of Etna's most recent eruption, Despite artefacts of the interferometric technique, we can observe a volcano-wide deflation, which is an expected consequence of the eruption, but which had not previously been appreciated, We quantify it using a simple model based on the change of pressure in a sphere located in an elastic half-space; the modelled deformation increases linearly with time until the end of the eruption. Our results show that it will be possible to use this technique to detect the inflation of volcanic edifices that usually precedes eruptions.},

It is shown that the observed changes in the range from the ground surface to the satellite agree well with the slip measured in the field, with the displacements measured by surveying, and with the results of Okada's (1985) elastic dislocation model. This interferogram provides a denser spatial sampling than surveying methods and a better precision than earlier space imaging techniques.},

The plugin is illustrated with a Gaussian and a logistic regression example. In the Gaussian regression example, the R2 value computed on a test dataset is R2 = 21.3{\%} for linear regression and R2 = 93.8{\%} for boosting. In the logistic regression example, stepwise logistic regression correctly classifies 54.1{\%} of the observations in a test dataset versus 76.0{\%} for boosted logistic regression. Currently, boost accommodates Gaussian (normal), logistic, and Poisson boosted regression. boost is implemented as a Windows C++ plugin.},

  abstract     = {The Belvedere Glacier, east face of Monte Rosa, has been investigated for many decades because of a long history of outburst threatening the village of Macugnaga and, in the latest years, a surge-type evolution, responsible for the formation of a large depression at the foot of the east wall of Monte Rosa, which hosted a supraglacial lake named "Lago Effimero" in summer 2002. In this contribution, a Ground Based SAR (GB-SAR) interferometer was employed for determining the ice-flow velocity of the illuminated part of the Belvedere Glacier in order to enhance the understanding of ice flow mechanics and hopefully reduce the glacier hazard. The deformation field and the velocities measured by the GB-SAR sensor have been validated with data by more conventional ground-based measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter shows that inverse problems can be classified on the basis of the mathematical structure of the theory connecting the data and model parameters. The simplest theory is the explicit linear theory, which has the form of a matrix equation relating a vector of model parameters to a vector of data. The most complicated is the implicit nonlinear problem, in which the data and model parameters are mixed together in nonlinear relationships. A series of six exemplary inverse problems are discussed, starting with the simple notion of fitting a straight line to data exhibiting a linear trend, and culminating with acoustic tomography and X-ray imaging. In each case, the mathematical relationship between the data and model parameters is derived and classified. The meaning of the term solution to an inverse problem is debated; for depending upon the context and one's point of view, any of several rather different quantities can be considered solutions. Solutions can include estimates of model parameters, deterministic or probabilistic bounds, probability density functions, and estimates of localized averages.

The phase correlation method measures ice$\backslash$nvelocity with a precision of 14 cm d(-1) (50 m a(-1)) with image$\backslash$ndata at a 6 m sample spacing acquired 1 day apart. Averaged strain$\backslash$nrates are measured with a precision of 10(-4) d(-1) at a 240 m sample$\backslash$nspacing with the phase correlation method, and 10(-5) d(-1) with$\backslash$nradar interferometry. The phase correlation method is less precise$\backslash$nthan radar interferometry, but it performs better in areas of rapid$\backslash$nflow, is more robust to temporal changes in glacier scattering and$\backslash$nmeasures the glacier velocity in two dimensions with only one image$\backslash$npair. Using this technique, we find that Glaciar Moreno flows at$\backslash$n400 m a(-1) in the terminal valley and 800 m a(-1) at the calving$\backslash$nfront, in agreement with velocities recorded a decade ago. Assuming$\backslash$nsteady-state now conditions, the vertical strain rates measured by$\backslash$nSIR-C are combined with prior data on mass ablation to estimate the$\backslash$nglacier thickness and ice discharge. The calculated discharge is$\backslash$n0.6 +/- 0.2 km(3) ice a(-1) at 300 m elevation, and 1.1 +/- 0.2 km3$\backslash$nice a(-1) at the equilibrium-line elevation (1150 m), which yields$\backslash$na balance accumulation of 6 +/- 1 m ice a(-1).},

Storstrommen, a large outlet glacier in northeastern Greenland which surged between 1978 and 1984 (ref. 2), has been well studied. In general, neither glacier surge mechanisms nor the geographical distribution of the surges are well known. Conventional satellite radar interferometry can provide large-scale topography models with high resolution(4), and can measure the radar line-of-sight component of ice-flow vector(5), but cannot map full vector flow fields, Here we present an interferometry method that combines observations from descending and ascending satellite orbits which, assuming ice flow parallel to the topographic surface, allows us to use the differing view angles to estimate full three-dimensional surface flow patterns, The accuracy of our technique is confirmed by the good agreement between our radar-based now model and in situ Global Positioning System (GPS) reference data at Storstrommen, Radar measurements such as these, made regularly and at high spatial density, have the potential to substantially enhance our understanding of glacier dynamics and ice-sheet flow, as well as improve the accuracy of glacier mass-balance estimates.},

  Abstract                 = {Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been widely used for Earth remote sensing for more than 30 years. It provides high-resolution, day-and-night and weather-independent images for a multitude of applications ranging from geoscience and climate change research, environmental and Earth system monitoring, 2-D and 3-D mapping, change detection, 4-D mapping (space and time), security-related applications up to planetary exploration. With the advances in radar technology and geo/bio-physical parameter inversion modeling in the 90s, using data from several airborne and spaceborne systems, a paradigm shift occurred from the development driven by the technology push to the user demand pull. Today, more than 15 spaceborne SAR systems are being operated for innumerous applications. This paper provides first a tutorial about the SAR principles and theory, followed by an overview of established techniques like polarimetry, interferometry and differential interferometry as well as of emerging techniques (e.g., polarimetric SAR interferometry, tomography and holographic tomography). Several application examples including the associated parameter inversion modeling are provided for each case. The paper also describes innovative technologies and concepts like digital beamforming, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) and bi- and multi-static configurations which are suitable means to fulfill the increasing user requirements. The paper concludes with a vision for SAR remote sensing.},

  Abstract                 = {Persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry (PSI) techniques are designed to measure ground deformations using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. They rely on the identification of pixels not severely affected by spatial or temporal decorrelation, which, in general, correspond to pointlike PSs commonly found in urban areas. However, in urban areas, we can find not only PSs but also distributed scatterers (DSs) whose phase information may be exploited for PSI applications. Estimation of DS parameters requires speckle filtering to be applied to the complex SAR data, but conventional speckle filtering approaches tend to mask PS information due to spatial averaging. In the context of single-polarization PSI, adaptive speckle filtering strategies based on the exploitation of amplitude temporal statistics have been proposed, which seek to avoid spatial filtering on nonhomogeneous areas. Given the growing interest on polarimetric PSI techniques, i.e., those using polarimetric diversity to increase performance over conventional single-polarization PSI, in this paper, we propose an adaptive spatial filter driven by polarimetric temporal statistics, rather than single-polarization amplitudes. The proposed approach is able to filter DS while preserving PS information. In addition, a new methodology for the joint processing of PS and DS in the context of PSI is introduced. The technique has been tested for two different urban data sets: 41 dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images of Murcia (Spain) and 31 full-polarization Radarsat-2 images of Barcelona (Spain). Results show an important improvement in terms of number of pixels with valid deformation information, hence denser area coverage.},

  Abstract                 = {In previous works, a general framework to exploit polarimetric diversity to optimize the results of persistent scatterers interferometry (PSI) was presented, but tested only with dual-pol data. In this paper, the performance of these algorithms is assessed using fully polarimetric data, acquired by the Radarsat-2 satellite over the urban area of Barcelona, Spain. In addition, two new highly efficient polarimetric optimization methods, mean intensity polarimetric optimization and joint diagonalization-based polarimetric optimization, are introduced and evaluated. Given the variety of dual-pol configurations provided by current polarimetric satellites, such as TerraSAR-X and Radarsat-2, and the upcoming launch of Sentinel-1, ALOS-2, and Radarsat Constellation Mission, a study has been also carried out to determine the best performing dual-pol configurations for polarimetric PSI. Subsidence maps of the area of study are computed for single-pol, dual-pol, and full-pol data, which show the increase in pixel density with valid deformation results as more polarimetric information is made available. In particular, for full-pol data we get an increase of up to 2.5 times more pixels for coherence-based PSI techniques (degraded resolution), and over four times more for amplitude-based approaches (full resolution), in comparison with single-pol data. Both higher density and quality of pixels yield better results in terms of coverage and accuracy.},

It also proposes using postprocessing of the change detected by the MAD variates using maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) analysis. The MAD and the combined MAF/MAD transformations are invariant to linear scaling. Therefore, they are insensitive, for example, to differences in gain settings in a measuring device, or to linear radiometric and atmospheric correction schemes. Other multivariate change detection schemes described are principal component type analyses of simple difference images. Case studies with AHVRR and Landsat MSS data using simple linear stretching and masking of the change images show the usefulness of the new MAD and MAF/MAD change detection schemes. Ground truth observations confirm the detected changes. A simple simulation of a no-change situation shows the accuracy of the MAD and MAF/MAD transformations compared to principal components based methods.},

  abstract     = {Belvedere Glacier, east face of the Mount Rosa, has experienced drastic changes in flow regime and morphology in the last years. Within the activities of the GALAHAD project funded by the European Commission, a ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) interferometer was employed on this glacier. Although based on the ground, the sensor works with the same principles as satellite radar interferometry measuring the deformation field of the illuminated surface. It was used for the first time on this glacier in 2004 and a new survey, here reported, was arranged last summer (2007). During this latter survey, the radar antenna moved around a vertical axis in order to illuminate a larger part of the glacier. It provided deformation maps of a wider part of the glacier every half an hour almost continually for 1 month. Finally, a procedure for building a digital elevation model (DEM) of the glacier was developed and the obtained DEM was compared with an available topographic map dated July 2005. Large differences in the ice surface height appear from the comparison confirming the overall reduction of the ice mass. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Radar sensing has been developed on the basis of four technological principles. These are: 1) the ability of an antenna to emit a brief electromagnetic pulse in a precise direction, 2) the ability to detect, also with directional precision, the greatly attenuated echo scattered from a target, 3) the ability to measure the time delay between emission and detection and thus the range to the target, and 4) the ability to scan with the directional beam and so examine an extended area for targets. A fifth principle, spectral analysis of precisely phase controlled signals, enables extreme enhancements of the application of the four physical principals. It is this last methodology which lies at the heart of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). By means of detection of small Doppler shifts in signals from targets in motion relative to the radar, it is possible to obtain, from limited peak power, imaging resolutions on the order of 3 arc seconds for spaceborne SAR and 0.01 arc second for planetary radar telescopy. These techniques depend on precise determination of the relative position and velocity of the radar with respect to the target, and on integrating the return signal information over a time period (or look ) which is long compared to the time between pulses (inter-pulse period , IPP).},

  Abstract                 = {1 Radar interferograms provide precise (millimeter level) measurements of crustal deformation at fine resolution over wide areas. The dominant error source in many interferograms results from spatial heterogeneity of the wet component of atmospheric refractivity, resulting in excess path length of the radar signal propagating through the neutral atmosphere. In this report, we introduce a method to compensate for atmospheric phase artifacts in a radar interferogram using spatially interpolated zenith wet delay (ZWD) data obtained from a network of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers in the region imaged by the radar. Our method, based on Taylor's "frozen-flow'' hypothesis, uses GPS data recorded prior to and after the individual radar acquisition times to infer denser spatial networks of control points for interpolation than is suggested by the sparse and irregular spatial distribution of GPS receivers. We test this approach by correcting phase fluctuations observed in a radar interferogram over an area covered by the Southern California Integrated GPS Network stations, using maps of atmospheric delay interpolated from the denser network of GPS ZWD measurements generated by our method. We find that the largest improvement results from removing an altitude-dependent model derived from the GPS data: the uncorrected interferogram in our example has an RMS fluctuation of 16.1 mm, which falls to 8.6 mm after the altitude correction. A map derived from ZWD measurements recorded only at the instances of radar acquisition reduced overall fluctuations in the data from 8.6 to 8.1 mm RMS, while using the inferred denser network reduces the error further to 7.5 mm RMS. Most of this residual variation is due to decorrelation of the signal and does not result from atmospheric propagation, however. After smoothing to remove decorrelation noise, the residual drops from 4.7 to 3.9 mm GPS stations only) and then to 2.7 mm RMS when the denser network algorithm is used.},

For this, a polarimetric coherent scattering model for vegetation cover suitable for the estimation of forest parameters frominterfer- ometric observables is introduced, discussed and validated. Based on this model, an inversion algorithm which allows the estimation of forest parameters such as tree height, average extinction, and underlying topography from single-baseline fully polarimetric in- terferometric data is addressed. The performance of the inversion algorithm is demonstrated using fully polarimetric single baseline experimental data acquired by DLR's E-SAR system at L-band.},

  Abstract                 = {By means of the permanent scatterer (PS) technique, repeated spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with relatively low resolution (about 25 m {\&}{\#}x00D7; 5 m for the European Remote Sensing (ERS) and Envisat satellites) can be used to estimate the displacement (1-mm precision) and 3-D location (1-m precision) of targets that show an unchanged electromagnetic signature. The main drawback of the PS technique is the limited spatial density of targets that behave coherently during the whole observation span (hundreds of PSs per square kilometer in urban site and up to few points in vegetated areas). In this paper, we describe a new approach for multitemporal analysis of SAR images that also allows extracting information from partially coherent targets. The basic idea is to loosen the restrictive conditions imposed by the PS technique. The results obtained in different test sites allowed to increase significantly the spatial coverage of the estimate of height and deformation trend, particularly in extraurban areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) deals with the combination of multi-temporal SAR images for the estimation of the linear and non-linear components of the deformation process within an area of interest during the whole observation period. A high stability of the platform is required for a reliable estimation of the geodetic phenomena. Accordingly, space-borne SAR images are operatively employed for DInSAR estimation, air-borne DInSAR still constituting a challenging research issue. SAR Polarimetry aims at charactering the illuminated area through the analysis of its response under different combinations of transmitting and receiving antennas polarization, called polarimetric channels. The Polarimetric SAR Interferometry joins the capability of Polarimetry to separate independent scattering mechanisms and the sensitivity of Interferometry to the corresponding phase centers' elevation, making it possible to describe the volumetric distribution of the scatterers within the observed area. Owing to the lack of long-time collections of polarimetric space-borne SAR data, the studies carried out in this research field have been mainly based on air-borne acquisitions. Yet, there is a great expectation for the improvements that polarimetry may bring to assessed single-polarization techniques such as the DinSAR. The research described in this PhD dissertation fills for the first time the gap between SAR Polarimetry and SAR Differential Interferometry through the employment of an X-band ground-based SAR (gbSAR) sensor developed by the Remote Sensing Lab of the Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya (UPC). The work is divided into two main blocks. The first part deals with the algorithms that have been developed to make the UPC system operative and its acquisitions easy to use. Summarily, they include the mathematical formulation of the sensor's working principles, the raw data processing chain and the polarimetric calibration method, the geocoding procedures, and the techniques compensating for the atmospheric artefacts affecting gbSAR zero-baseline acquisitions. The second part is concerned with demonstrating the benefits that polarimetric SAR measurements provide with respect to single-polarization data for differential applications. In order to cope with this task, the data sets acquired during a one-year measurement campaign carried out in the village of Sallent, northeastern Spain, are analyzed. The experiment was focused on monitoring the subsidence phenomenon affecting a district of the village with the UPC gbSAR sensor. Three main issues are here argued. The first one is the time non-stationary behaviors characterizing the urban environment at X-band in the gbSAR observation geometry. Their effects are analyzed in detail and a novel non-stationary filtering technique tailored to deterministic scatterers' properties is introduced to preserve the differential phase information. The second one is the compensation of the troposphere changes in long-time span gbSAR differential interferograms. A new technique is worked out to effectively separate the differential phase variations due to the atmospheric artefacts from the deformation components. The third one is the use of the whole polarimetric differential information. A novel polarimetric differential scattering model is put forward to relax the constraints of an advanced DInSAR technique, the Coherent Pixel Technique, and to propose an innovative polarimetric approach. The advantages offered by Polarimetric DInSAR are demonstrated in terms of quality of the deformation-rate map describing the subsidence phenomenon in Sallent. In the end, the potentials of coherence-optimization techniques for the further improvement of the deformation process estimation are stressed.},

  Abstract                 = {Revisiting time constitutes a key constraint for continuous monitoring activities based on space- and airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. Conversely, the employment of terrestrial platforms overcomes this limitation and makes it possible to perform time-continuous observations of small space-scale phenomena. New research lines of SAR dealing with the backscattering evolution of different types of scenarios become hence possible through the analysis of ground-based SAR (gbSAR) data collections. The Remote Sensing Laboratory of the Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya drove a one-year measurements campaign in the village of Sallent, northeastern Spain, using its X-Band gbSAR sensor. The field experiment aimed at studying the subsidence phenomenon induced by the salt mining activity carried out in this area during the past decades. In this paper, the polarimetric behavior of an urban environment is investigated at different time scales. After a brief description of the test site and the measurement campaign, the analysis is focused on the stability on man-made structures at different time scales. PolSAR data monthly acquired from June 2006 to July 2007 are employed to stress the presence of nonstationary backscattering processes within the urban scene and the effect they have on differential phase information. Then, a filtering procedure aiming at reducing backscattering randomness in one-day and long-term data collections is then put forward. The improvements provided by the proposed technique are assessed using a new polarimetric descriptor, the time entropy. In the end, the importance of preserving the interferometric phase information from nonstationary backscattering contaminations using fully polarimetric data is discussed},

A method for predicting the time of failure is then discussed. The disaggregation of the unstable ice masses usually observed prior to large icefalls is investigated and its implications for the forecasting of icefalls analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {In repeat-pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), man-made scene disturbances are commonly detected by identifying changes in the mean backscatter power of the scene or by identifying regions of low coherence. Change statistics such as the sample mean backscatter-power ratio and the sample coherence, however, are susceptible to high false-alarm rates unless the change in the mean backscatter power is large or there is sufficient contrast in scene coherence between the changed and unchanged regions of the image pair. Furthermore, as the sample mean backscatter-power ratio and sample coherence measure different properties of a SAR image pair, both change statistics need to be considered to properly characterize scene changes. In this paper, models describing the changed and unchanged regions of a scene are postulated, and the detection problem is expressed in a Bayesian hypothesis-testing framework. Forming the log-likelihood ratio gives a single sufficient statistic, encoding changes in both the coherence and the mean backscatter power, for discriminating between the unchanged- and changed-scene models. The theoretical detection performance of the change statistic is derived and shows a significant improvement over both the sample mean backscatter-power ratio and sample coherence change statistics. Finally, the superior detection performance of the log-likelihood change statistic is demonstrated using experimental data collected using the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Ingara X-band airborne SAR},

The linear distortion model is$\backslash$nshown to lead to an inconsistent system of equations; this inconsistency$\backslash$ncan be removed by introducing an extra parameter which has properties$\backslash$nexpected of system noise. The modulus of the copolarized correlation$\backslash$ncoefficient, which is important in polarimetric classification and as a$\backslash$nphase descriptor, is shown to be invariant under all effects embodied in$\backslash$nthe linear distortion model.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new automatic change detection technique for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series, i.e., Method for generalIzed Means Ordered Series Analysis (MIMOSA). The method compares only two different temporal means between the amplitude images, whatever the length of the time series. The method involves three different steps: 1) estimation of the amplitude distribution parameters over the images; 2) computation of the theoretical joint probability density function between the two temporal means; and 3) automatic thresholding according to a given false alarm rate, which is the only change detection parameter. The procedure is executed with a very low computational cost and does not require any spatial speckle filtering. Indeed, the full image resolution is used. Due to the temporal means, the data volume to process is reduced, which is very helpful. Moreover, the two means can be simply updated using the new incoming images only. Thus, the full time series is not processed again. Change detection results between image pairs are presented with the airborne sensor CARABAS-II, using a public data release, and with TerraSAR-X data. In the case of time series, change detection results are illustrated using a TerraSAR-X time series. In every case, the MIMOSA method produces very good results.},

We investigate whether the interferometric data are quantitatively consistent with terrestrial velocity measurements along three transverse profiles. These terrestrial data are from different years (1987, 1990, 1996) and cover different periods (6-28 April, 23 May-7 July and a whole year) than the SAR interferogram. Terrestrial ice velocity at the date of the SAR imagery is obtained via seasonal and annual corrections that are calculated from other terrestrial velocity measurements available at higher time resolution for selected sites on the glacier. Interferometric and terrestrial velocity are in excellent agreement if a (terrestrially measured) surface-normal velocity component (upsilon(perpendicular to)) is properly accounted for. This suggests that both the interferometric velocities and the conversions of terrestrial data to the winter period are reliable. The terrestrial velocity measurements show that ice now in the upper ablation area (14-16 km sites) changes from longitudinal compression in mid-winter (upsilon(perpendicular to) = +0.82 cm d(-1)) to moderate longitudinal extension during summer (upsilon(perpendicular to) approximate to -0.25 cm d(-1)). In the lower ablation area, the seasonal variations of the longitudinal strain rate are much smaller: +1.0 and about +0.85 cm d(-1) for the respective mid-winter and summer values of upsilon(perpendicular to) at the 20 km site.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic models are often used to describe the spatial structure of atmospheric phase delays in differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) data. Synthetic aperture radar interferograms often exhibit anisotropic atmospheric signals. In view of this, the use of anisotropic models for atmospheric phase estimation is increasingly advocated. However, anisotropic models lead to increased computational complexity in estimating the correlation function parameters with respect to the isotropic case. Moreover, the performance is degraded when dealing with DInSAR techniques involving only a few sparse points usable for computations, as in the case of persistent scatterer interferometry applications, particularly when this estimation has to be done in an automated way on many interferograms. In the present work, we propose some observations about the actual advantage given by anisotropic modeling of atmospheric phase in the case of sparse-grid point-target DInSAR applications. Through analysis of simulated data, we observe that an improvement in the performances of kriging reconstruction approaches can be obtained only when sufficient sampling densities are available. In critical sampling conditions, automated methods with reasonable computational cost may improve their performance if external information on the atmospheric phase screen field is available.},

  Abstract                 = {Sparse phase measurements often need to be interpolated on regular grids, to extend the information to unsampled locations. Typical cases involve the removal of atmospheric phase screen information from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) stacks, or the retrieval of displacement information over extended areas in Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) applications, when sufficient point densities are available. This operation is usually done after a phase unwrapping (PU) of the sparse measurements to remove the sharp phase discontinuities due to the wrap operation. PU is a difficult and error-prone operation, especially for sparse data. In this work, we investigate from the empirical point of view an alternative procedure, which involves an interpolation of the complex field derived from the sparse phase measurements. Unlike traditional approaches, our method allows to bypass the PU step and obtain a regular-grid complex field from which a wrapped phase field can be extracted. Under general conditions, this can be shown to be a good approximation of the original phase without noise. Moreover, the interpolated, wrapped phase field can be fed to state-of-the-art, regular-grid PU algorithms, to obtain an improved absolute phase field, compared to the canonical method consisting of first unwrapping the sparse-grid data. We evaluate the performance of the method in simulation, comparing it to the classical methodology described above, as well as to an alternative procedure, recently proposed, to reduce a sparse PU problem to a regular-grid one, through a nearest-neighbor interpolation step. Results confirm the increased robustness of the proposed method with respect to the effects of noise and undersampling.},

The GPRI tracked the surface ice motion in line of sight over an area of 3km2 down-glacier of Gornersee almost continuously during the drainage event. The displacement maps derived from the acquired interferograms capture the spatial distribution of the surface ice motion. Due to fast acquisition times of the microwave images, the GPRI was able to record sub-daily variations of the ice displacements, most likely caused by the impact of the Gornersee drainage on the ice motion of Gornergletscher. In situ point measurements of the ice displacement agree reasonably well with the results obtained by the GPRI and highlight the use of the GPRI for high-resolution measurements of glacier surface ice motion.},

  Abstract                 = {Several techniques for detecting temporal changes in satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery are compared using both theoretical predictions and spaceborne SAR data collected by the European first Remote Sensing Satellite, ERS- 1. In a first set of techniques, changes are detected based on differences in the magnitude of the signal intensity between two dates. Ratioing of the multidate radar intensities is shown to be better adapted to the statistical characteristics of SAR data than subtracting, and works best when the number of looks is large. In a second set of techniques, changes are detected based on estimates of the temporal decorrelation of speckle. This method works best with one-look complex amplitude data, but can also be used with intensity data provided that the number of looks is small. The two techniques, ratioing of the signal intensity and decorrelation of speckle, are compared using actual SAR data collected by ERS-1. The results illustrate the viability as well as the complementary character of these techniques for detecting changes in the structural and dielectric properties of remotely sensed surfaces. Finally, change detection using the ratio method is applied to mosaics of repeat-pass SAR imagery to illustrate the potential of this method for monitoring applications at the regional scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Synthetic aperture radar interferometry is limited by temporal and geometrical decorrelation. Permanent scatterers (PSs) are helpful to overcome these problems, but their density in agricultural and out-of-town areas is not always sufficient. The forthcoming availability of satellite platforms with thinner orbital tubes and shorter revisit times will enhance the use of interferogram stacks, which are usable for distributed and progressively decorrelating targets, like those found in agricultural areas. To estimate the possibilities of the interferogram stack technique, a Markovian model for the temporal decorrelation is considered. ERS-1 data measured in C-band over Rome with a three-day repeat cycle are used to identify the parameters for this model, namely, the decorrelation time (estimated as 40 days) and the short-term coherence (estimated as 0.6). In the hypothesis of small deviations from a model of the motion, the optimal weights to be used to combine a sequence of interferograms taken at intervals that are shorter than the decorrelation time are calculated in the cases of progressive and sinusoidal ground motion. The dispersion of the optimal estimate of the motion is then determined. This model is extended to frequencies other than C-band. These evaluations are compared with the known results obtained for PSs. As an example, the case of a time interval between the takes of T = 12 days is considered. With N consecutive images, interferogram stack results are equivalent to PSs if the pixel count in the window used to smooth the interferograms grows with N2.},

It is shown that all magnitudes and phases (relative to one of the like-polarized linear polarization configurations) of the radar transfer function can be calibrated without knowledge of the scattering matrix of the second target. Comparison of values measured (using this calibration technique) for a tilted cylinder at X-band with theoretical values shows agreement with + or - 0.3 dB in magnitude and + or - 5 deg in phase. The technique is particularly useful for calibrating a radar under field conditions because it does not require careful alignment of calibration targets.},

It is not possible to get both high range and angular resolution in a radar using the slotted waveguide antenna. An expression is derived which shows that the product of range and angular resolution is constant. Therefore, if the angular resolution is increased, then range resolution will be decreased. For example, a slotted waveguide antenna of 6-m length gave a beamwidth of 0.4 degrees . The transmitted pulsewidth could not be lowered below 3T/sub t/=84 ns at 9375 MHz, where T/sub t/ is the transit time.},

  Abstract                 = {Image-to-image cross-correlation software is applied to pairs of digital satellite images to map the velocity field of moving ice. This technique uses small-scale glacial surface features, such as crevasse scars and snow dunes, as markers on the surface of the moving ice. Displacements of the surface features are mapped by selecting small image areas centered on distinct features, or by dividing a large area of densely featured glacial surface into a grid of areas, and searching a subsequent image for matching areas using a cross-correlation algorithm. Interpolation of the peak correlation values allows the displacements to be measured to subpixel accuracy, resulting in very precise velocity measurements. Cross-correlation is also applied to provide image coregistration in areas devoid of bedrock exposures. In such areas, subtle large-scale topographic undulations in the ice surface, related to underlying bedrock structure, may be correlated by using large image areas and low-pass filtered images. Both types of applications are demonstrated, using Ice Stream D and Ice Stream E in West Antarctica as test areas. A high-resolution map of the velocity field of the central portion of Ice Stream E, generated by the displacement-measuring technique, is presented. The use of cross-correlation software is a significant improvement over previous manually-based photogrammetric methods for velocity measurement, and is far more cost-effective than in situ methods in remote polar areas. ?? 1992.},

The time-dependent deformation is calculated by performing a linear inversion that solves for the incremental range change between SAR scene acquisitions. A nonlinear range change signal is extracted from the ERS InSAR data without imposing a model of the expected deformation. In the Santa Clara valley, cumulative land uplift is observed during the period from 1992 to 2000 with a maximum uplift of 41 ± 18 mm centered north of Sunnyvale. Uplift is also observed east of San Jose. Seasonal uplift and subsidence dominate west of the Silver Creek fault near San Jose with a maximum peak-to-trough amplitude of ∼35 mm. The pattern of seasonal versus long-term uplift provides constraints on the spatial and temporal characteristics of water-bearing units within the aquifer. The Silver Creek fault partitions the uplift behavior of the basin, suggesting that it acts as a hydrologic barrier to groundwater flow. While no tectonic creep is observed along the fault, the development of a low-permeability barrier that bisects the alluvium suggests that the fault has been active since the deposition of Quaternary units.},

  Abstract                 = {These days passive microwave (MW) remote sensing has found many applications. For example, in Earth observation missions, it is possible to estimate the salinity of oceans, the soil moisture of landscapes, or to extract atmospheric parameters like the liquid water content of clouds [1, 2, 3]. Due to the penetration capabilities of microwaves through many dielectric materials, and the purely passive character of this kind of remote sensing, this technique nowadays is considered as well in many security and reconnaissance applications (e.g. observation of sensitive areas, detection of concealed objects, trough-wall imaging, etc.). Presently different imaging principles for MW radiometry are possible. Most of them still are based on pure mechanical scanning or they combine this with electronic scanning by using parts of a focal plane array [4]. Due to many advantages, the technological trend is going towards fully-electronic beam steering or two-dimensional focal plane arrays. These systems are able to achieve high frame rates, but they are still very expensive because of a significantly higher number of receiver modules, compared to a mechanical scanning system. In our approach a novel concept for a Ka band fully-electronic wide swath MW imaging radiometer system is introduced [5]. It is based on a combination of beam steering by frequency shift for one scanning direction using a slottedwaveguide antenna, and the application of aperture synthesis in the other. In the following a proof of concept is outlined using a two-element interferometer system called VESAS (Voll elektronischer Scanner mit Apertursynthese) demonstrator. The advantage of using the aperture synthesis technique is the possibility to implement minimal redundant sparse arrays without a degradation of the antenna pattern. In combination with the beam steering by frequency shift, one requires a one dimensional receiver/antenna array for a two dimensional imaging, hence a low-cost, fully-electronic wide swath microwave radiometer system with high frame rates is feasible. In the following a proof of concept is outlined by presenting different MW imaging measurement results, using this kind of imaging principle.{\textcopyright} 2013 SPIE.},

  Abstract                 = {Die Internationale Rheinschutzkommission (IKSR) koordiniert seit 1990 biologische Bestandsaufnahmen vom Bodensee bis zur Nordsee. In diesem Rahmen wurde im Auftrag des Bundesamtes f{\"{u}}r Umwelt (BAFU, Bern) und der Landesanstalt f{\"{u}}r Um- welt, Messungen und Naturschutz Baden-W{\"{u}}rttemberg (LUBW) im Herbst 2006 und im Fr{\"{u}}hjahr 2007 bereits zum vierten Mal seit 1990 das Zoobenthos des Hochrheins untersucht. Die Aufnahmen fanden wieder an neun repr{\"{a}}sentativen Flussquerschnitten zwischen Bodensee und Basel statt. Diese repr{\"{a}}sentieren den Bodenseeabfluss (Ab- schnitt A), den naturnahen Hochrhein oberhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (Abschnitt B), den ausgebauten und staubeeinflussten Hochrhein unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (Abschnitt C) und den durch Grossschiffahrt gepr{\"{a}}gten Hochrhein von Rheinfelden bis Basel (Abschnitt D). Im L{\"{a}}ngsverlauf des Hochrheins wurden wie in fr{\"{u}}heren Kampagnen deutliche Unter- schiede in der Besiedlung der Flusssohle festgestellt: in naturnahen Hochrheinabschnit- ten oberhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (A und B) dominierten wie bisher die Wasserinsekten. In den Rheinabschnitten unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung (C und D) waren es Mollusken (Muscheln und Schnecken) und Crustaceen (Krebstiere). Zwischen 1995 und 2007 liessen sich deutliche Ver{\"{a}}nderungen der Sohlenbesiedlung feststellen. Die Flusskahnschnecke Theodoxus fluviatilis, 1995 noch eine der dominan- ten Arten im Raum Basel, verschwand bis 2002 v{\"{o}}llig aus dem Hochrhein. Die Be- st{\"{a}}nde der Zebramuschel Dreissena polymorpha gingen seit etwa 2000 unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung stark zur{\"{u}}ck. Anderen, dort zuvor ebenfalls h{\"{a}}ufigen Taxa erging es {\"{a}}hnlich: Flohkrebsarten der Gattung Gammarus, die Eintagsfliege Heptagenia sulphu- rea und die K{\"{o}}cherfliege Cheumatopsyche lepida sind sehr selten geworden; Strudel- w{\"{u}}rmer, die Schnecke Bithynia tentaculata, Eintagsfliegen der Gattung Baetis und Kriebelm{\"{u}}cken (Simulium sp.) wurden gar nicht mehr nachgewiesen. Ursache f{\"{u}}r diese Ver{\"{a}}nderungen ist offensichtlich das aggressive Frass- und Raumnutzungsverhalten invasiver Neozoenarten, von denen sich seit 1995 mindestens sechs neu im unteren Hochrhein etabliert haben. Dagegen weist die Benthosbesiedlung in den naturnahen oberen Hochrheinabschnitten noch immer eine stabile Besiedlung mit angestammten Arten auf. Massenvermehrungen von Neozoen sind auch f{\"{u}}r die erheblichen Unterschiede in den Biomassewerten verantwortlich. W{\"{a}}hrend naturnahe Stellen nur geringe Benthos- Biomassen aufwiesen, lagen diese an Stellen unterhalb der Aarem{\"{u}}ndung mit hohen Dichten der K{\"{o}}rbchenmuschel Corbicula fluminea und der grossen neozoischen Floh- krebse um ein Vielfaches h{\"{o}}her. Im Bodenseeabfluss bei Hemishofen sorgten die noch immer dichten Best{\"{a}}nde der Zebramuschel f{\"{u}}r eine hohe Biomasse. Die im Hochrhein vorhandene Nahrungsgrundlage wirkt sich also auf die Massenvermehrung von invasi- ven Neozoen nicht limitierend aus. Grenzen werden ihnen lediglich durch das jeweilige Lebensraumangebot und die selektiv wirkenden Umgebungsfaktoren (Temperatur, Str{\"{o}}mung, Substrat) gesetzt. Im naturnahen Hochrheinabschnitt B konnten sich invasive Neozoenarten noch nicht etablieren. Auch im Abschnitt A, wo der grosse H{\"{o}}ckerflohkrebs Dikerogammarus villosus vom Bodensee her eingedrungen ist, war noch kein negativer Einfluss auf die angestammte Benthosbioz{\"{o}}nose zu erkennen. Dies l{\"{a}}sst den Schluss zu, dass die weitere massive Ausbreitung von Neozoen nur begrenzt werden kann, wenn die Le- bensbedingungen und Konkurrenzvorteile der typischen Rheinarten durch eine natur- nahe Morphologie, Str{\"{o}}mungs- und Abflusscharakteristik des Hochrheins erhalten und gef{\"{o}}rdert werden.},

This paper marks a stage at which it is possible to summarize some advances in the state of the art and associated innovations that can be attributed to early motivation by Wilfried Haeberli and offers a tribute as well as gratitude for his ongoing feedback and advice. Some thoughts on the development of thermokarst due to water ponding and flow, and a conceptual model of geotechnical mechanisms that aim to explain some aspects of rock glacier kinematics, are also introduced.},

  Abstract                 = {Identification concerning different types of radar targets can be achieved by using various radar signatures, such as one-dimensional (1-D) range profiles, 2-D radar images, and 1-D or 2-D scattering centres on a target. To solve the target identification problem, the authors utilise 1-D scattering centres, which correspond to the highest peaks in the 1-D range profile. The proposed approach obtains scale and translational-invariant features based on the central moments from the distribution of the 1-D scattering centres on the target; these 1-D scattering centres can be extracted from various techniques such as inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT), fast root-multiple signal classification (fast root-MUSIC), total least squares-Prony (TLS-Prony), generalised eigenvalues utilising signal subspace eigenvectors (GEESE), and the matrix-pencil (MP) algorithm. The information redundancy contained in these features, as well as their dimensions, are further reduced via the Karhunen–Loeve transform, followed by adequate scaling of the computed central moments. The resulting small dimensional and redundancy-free feature vectors are classified using the Bayes classifier. Finally, this new strategy for radar-target identification is demonstrated with data measured in the compact range facility, and the above five different techniques for 1-D scattering centre extraction are compared and investigated in the context of target identification},

FMCW is finding applications in such diverse fields as naval tactical navigation radars, smart ammunition sensors and automotive radars. The paper discusses some features of FMCW radar which are not dealt with in much detail in the generally available literature. In particular, it discusses the effects of noise reflected back from the transmitter to the receiver and the application of moving target indication to FMCW radars. Some of the strengths and weaknesses of FMCW radar are considered. The paper describes how the strengths are utilised in some systems and how the weaknesses can be mitigated. It also discusses a modern implementation of a reflected power canceller, which can be used to suppress the leakage between the transmitter and the receiver, a well known problem with continuous wave radars},

Currently, the detection of the state of activity of these very rapidly moving rockglaciers is hardly feasible with sate llite SAR data, because of signal decorrelation after the 35, 46 and 11 days repeat intervals of the ENVISA T, ALOS and TerraSAR-X satellites, respectively. The role of space-borne radar interferometry as an element in a warning system is thus insignificant for these very rapid landslides, but an in- situ radar imaging system can overcome some of the limitations of satellite systems. In this contribution we present results from terrestrial radar interferometric measurements of two destabilized rockglaciers performed in August 2009.},

Intensity tracking, based on patch intensity cross-correlation optimization, and coherence tracking, based on patch coherence optimization, are used to estimate the movement of glacier surfaces between two SAR images in both slant-range and azimuth direction. The accuracy and application range of the two methods are examined in the case of the surge of Monacobreen in Northern Svalbard between 1992 and 1996. Offset-tracking procedures of SAR images are an alternative to differential SAR interferometry for the estimation of glacier motion when differential SAR interferometry is limited by loss of coherence, i.e. in the case of rapid and incoherent flow and of large acquisition time intervals between the two SAR images. In addition, an offset-tracking procedure in the azimuth direction may be combined with differential SAR interferometry in the slant-range direction in order to retrieve a two-dimensional displacement map when SAR data of only one orbit configuration are available.},

  Abstract                 = {In this letter, the requirements to derive topography from a portable terrestrial radar interferometer are introduced, the instrument design and the relationship between interferometric phase shift and surface topography are explained, and two examples of topographic maps from measurements at the Rhone glacier and Grabengufer rock glacier in Switzerland are presented. In the first case, an external digital elevation model was used to assess the error of topography mapping with the portable radar interferometer and to analyze ice surface changes of the glacier in the last 14 years. We found that the height error standard deviation is about 3 m within a distance of 2 km from the sensor and observed massive thinning of the Rhone glacier. In the second case, we used the terrestrial radar interferometer in order to measure the height difference between August 2009 and March 2010 over the rock glacier as a consequence of its destabilization.},

In order to permit the incorporation of any a priori information about parameters and any distribution of data (not only of gaussian type) we propose to formulate the problem not using single quantities (such as bounds, means, etc.) but using probability density functions for data and parameters. We also want our formulation to allow for the incorporation of theoretical errors, i.e. non-exact theoretical relationships between data and parameters (due to discretization, or incomplete theoretical knowledge); to do that in a natural way we propose to define general theoretical relationships also as probability density functions. We show then that the inverse problem may be formulated as a problem of combination of information: the experimental information about data, the a priori information about parameters, and the theoretical information. With this approach, the general solution of the non-linear inverse problem is unique and consistent (solving the same problem, with the same data, but with a different system of parameters does not change the solution).},

  Abstract                 = {This is the first in a series of two papers on the use of active microwave remote sensing for measuring the moisture content of bare (Part I) and vegetation-covered (Part II) soil. An experimental program was conducted to evaluate the response of the backscattering coefficient to soil moisture content as a means to specify radar system parameters for future airborne and/or spaceborne soil moisture mappers. Particular attention was paid to the effects of surface roughness, and a preliminary examination of the role of soil texture was performed. The results of this investigation confirm the findings of a previous experiment [1] which concluded that the effects of surface roughness can be minimized by operating at a frequency in the neighborhood of 5 GHz over the 7-17° angle of incidence range. The precision with which soil moisture in the surface soil layer can be estimated is comparable to the precision of the ground-truthed estimate. Because the moisture in the surface layer is highly correlated to the subsurface moisture, it was not possible to determine experimentally the effective depth of the layer responsible for the observed radar backscatter.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the statistical behavior of the phase difference AO between the HH-polarized and VV-polarized backscattered signals recorded by an L-band SAR over an agricultural test site in Illinois. Polarization-phase difference ({\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿) distributions were generated for about 200 agricultural fields for which ground information had been acquired in conjunction with the SAR mission. For the over-whelming majority of cases, the AX distribution is symmetrical and has a single major lobe centered at the mean value of the disstribution {\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿ Whereas the mean AX was found to be close to zero degrees for bare soil, cut vegetation, alfalfa, soybeans, and clover, a different pattern was observed for the corn fields; the mean {\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}¿ increased with increasing incidence angle 0 from about zero at 0 = 150 (near-range of the image) to about 140{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}° at 0 = 35{\~{A}}‚{\^{A}}°. The explanation proposed for this variation is that the corn canopy, most of whose mass is contained in its vertical stalks, acts like a uniaxial crystal characterized by different velocities of propogation for waves with horizontal and vertical polarization. Thus, it is hypothesized that the observed backscatter is contributed by a combination of propagation delay, forward scatter by the soil surface, and specular bistatic reflection by the stalks. Model calculations based on this assumption were found to be in general agreement with the phase observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) operating in the VHF band and used in conjunction with change detection has shown promising results for wide-area surveillance of ground targets. By using VHF-band frequencies, both targets in the open as well as concealed by foliage may be detected in a robust manner. VHF-band SAR is able to detect hidden targets because both foliage attenuation and clutter backscatter is small. The clutter is further suppressed through the use of change detection, thus significantly reducing the false alarms. VHF-band SAR is suitable for change detection since temporal decorrelation is small. An extensive data base of VHF-band SAR and target data was collected during the summer of 2002. The primary goal of this collection was to evaluate VHF-band SAR change detection performance under various operating conditions. In general, the results show that a VHF-band SAR employing change detection can reliably detect truck-sized targets hidden in foliage. However, the detection performance deteriorates under certain operating conditions, e.g. for near-grazing angles.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) is becoming state of the art for the compensation of atmospheric effects in InSAR and especially in PSI. The structure function (variogram) estimated on the InSAR data and on the NWP data is a required statistical characteristic and very useful in the processing of the data. For example, the structure function (typically the semivariogram) estimated on InSAR data is fundamental for the Kriging of the atmospheric phase screen (APS) based on irregular PSI estimates. The required parameters are the nugget, the range and the slope of the structure function. The practical implementation has shown that the NWP predicted structure function and the InSAR estimated structure function based on the conventional semivariogram equation do not match. Straightforward explanations are wrongly estimated APSs due to an insufficient number of interferograms or hindcasts that fail to capture the turbulent water vapour signal. However, in this paper we explain the effects of noise in interferograms and coarse resolution in the NWP on the conventional structure function estimation resulting in the observed mismatch. In order to avoid the mismatch, an alternative implementation based on wavelets is suggested and demonstrated using real Sentinel-1 data. We show that the wavelet based structure function estimation outperforms the conventional structure function estimation based on a variogram. Application of the proposed structure function alternative based on NWP data are the master selection, the estimation of the effective NWP data resolution, and a statistical consistency check of the estimated InSAR APS. To support the understanding, we demonstrate the effects of noise and resolution using simulated fractals. An application of the proposed wavelet based structure function estimation is the estimation of the effective NWP data resolution, which is demonstrated using the same Sentinel-1 data test case.},

The ice velocities were as high as 5md{\_}1, with the fastest velocities near the calving front. Retreat of the glacier over the 3 year observation period was accompanied by strong embayment formation. Iceberg tracking with the radar shows high current velocities near the embayment, probably indicating strong meltwater outflow and mixing with relatively warm lagoon water.},

  Abstract                 = {he potential of SAR interferometry for forest map- ping and monitoring is discussed. It is shown that forest can clearly be discriminated from other land categories. Furthermore it is possible to distinguish a number of forest types. The pre- sented approach is based on the SAR interferometric correlation and the backscatter intensities using ERS-1 SAR repeat-pass data. Baseline, time interval, and seasonal dependences were analyzed, substantiating a wide applicability of the approach. Data over an Alaskan test site were used to extend the results found over temperate forest to boreal forest and to demonstrate the potential of the described technique over remote areas. In addition, repeat-pass SAR interferometry was found to be particularly sensitive to change. Examples for the recognition of freezing, mechanical cultivation of agricultural fields, and canopy growth are shown. I.},

  Abstract                 = {Satellite interferometry has been used extensively for ground-motion monitoring with good success. In the case of landslides, for example, space-borne SAR interferometry has a good potential to get an overview on the slope stability. The role of a space-borne INSAR as an element in a landslide or rock fall warning system is constrained by the specific space-borne SAR imaging geometry, the typical multiple-week repeat-interval, and uncertainties in the data availability. Most of these limitations can be overcome with an in-situ radar imaging system. GAMMA has developed a portable radar interferometer that utilizes real-aperture antennas to obtain high azimuth resolution. Images are acquired line by line while rotating the transmitting and receiving antennas about a vertical axis. Phase differences between successive images acquired from the same location are used to determine line-of-sight displacements. The instrument operates at 17.2 GHz and has measurement sensitivity better than 1 mm. The instrument uses two receiving antennas with a short baseline to form an interferometer. Phase differences between simultaneous acquisitions by these antennas are used to calculate the precise look angle relative to the baseline, permitting derivation of the surface topography. Expected statistical noise in the height measurements is on the order of 1 meter. In this contribution the design, measurement principles and characteristics of GAMMA's Portable Radar Interferometer (GPRI) are presented.},

Using this capability is possible to generate DEMs, and measure mm-scale deformation on short and longer time-scales. Ground-based interferometric observations are complementary to spaceborne or airborne SAR based measurements because they can be acquired continuously and can be processed to mitigate the effects of temporal decorrelation and atmospheric phase variability.},

The technique uses a distortion matrix model for the errors introduced by the transmitter and receiver, and it is applicable to any polarimetric radar system where the concept of an invariant distortion matrix is valid. A sphere and two arbitrary passive targets are used to calibrate the radar with respect to the unknown polarization transmitted when the v-polarized channel is energized. The unknown transmitted polarization is then recovered by measuring any nondepolar- izing target. Because knowledge of the scattering matrices for the two arbitrary targets is not required, the technique is insensitive to errors in the orientation of calibration targets. Experimental results are presented, and they indicate magnitude and relative phase measurement errors of less than 0.2 dB and 2 {\o}, respectively.},

The topic is treated from both intuitive and theoretical aspects. A key requirement of STAP is knowledge of the spectral characteristics underlying the interference scenario of interest. Additional issues of importance in STAP include the computational cost of the adaptive algorithm as well as the ability to maintain a constant false alarm rate (CFAR) over widely varying interference statistics. This article addresses these topics, developing the need for a knowledge-based (KB) perspective. The focus here is on signal processing for radar systems using multiple antenna elements that coherently process multiple pulses. An adaptive array of spatially distributed sensors, which processes multiple temporal snapshots, overcomes the directivity and resolution limitations of a single sensor.},

We achieve results more accurate than previous space studies and similar in accuracy to those obtained by conventional field survey techniques. Data from the ERS 1 synthetic aperture radar instrument acquired in April, July, and August 1992 are used to generate a high-resolution, wide area map of the displacements. The data represent the motion in the direction of the radar line of sight to centimeter level precision of each 30-m resolution element in a 113 km by 90 km image. Our coseismic displacement contour map gives a lobed pattern consistent with theoretical models of the displacement field from the earthquake. Fine structure observed as displacement tiling in regions several kilometers from the fault appears to be the result of local surface fracturing. Comparison of these data with Global Positioning System and electronic distance measurement survey data yield a correlation of 0.96; thus the radar measurements are a means to extend the point measurements acquired by traditional techniques to an area map format. The technique we use is (1) more automatic, (2) more precise, and (3) better validated than previous similar applications of differential radar interferometry. Since we require only remotely sensed satellite data with no additional requirements for ancillary information, the technique is well suited for global seismic monitoring and analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (PolInSAR) combines SAR polarimetry and SAR interferometry and is much more sensitive to the distribution of orientated scatterers compared with polarimetric or interferometric data alone. The polarimetric similarity parameter is an efficient parameter to analyze target characteristics using the similarity between a target and the canonical target. In this letter, the polarimetric interferometric eigenvalue similarity parameter (PIESP) is proposed based on the similarity between two polarimetric SAR images obtained by two interferometric antennas. The PIESP is defined by the eigenvalues of two polarimetric coherence matrices in the PolInSAR system, and the eigenvalues of polarimetric coherence matrix are independent on the target orientation angle; therefore, the PIESP is rotation invariant. PolInSAR systems use two antennas to measure the same ground area with slightly different image geometry. Thus, the PIESP can be used to distinguish the target based on coherence and similarity. Then, the target detection method using the PIESP is implemented with the DLR experimental SAR L-band full polarized image of the Oberpfaffenhofen test site of Germany obtained on September 30, 2000. The results confirmed that the proposed model is accurate and effective for the detection and the analysis of buildings in urban areas.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a ground-based polarimetric broadband synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system for noninvasive ground-truth validation in polarimetric SAR remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation cover. This system consists of a vector network analyzer, one dual-polarized antenna, and an antenna positioner. It can be operated in a frequency range from 50 MHz to 20 GHz, with a scanning aperture of 20 m in the horizontal and 1.5 m in the vertical direction. Tests carried out with standard reflectors showed that the polarimetric measurement capabilities of this system are satisfactory. Using the polarimetric ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) system, we carried out measurements on a specific vegetation cover pertinent to the remote sensing of forested regions within Sendai City, consisting of three different kinds of trees common within the Kawauchi Campus of Tohoku University. Measurements were collected in spring, summer, and autumn. Three-dimensional (3-D) polarization-sensitive images were reconstructed from the acquired data. Analysis of the 3-D polarimetric images of each measurement found differences (at times strong differences) among the polarization signatures. There were stronger reflections in all of the HH, VH, VV images in the second (summer) measurement, especially in the VH image, due to the substantial growth of branches and leaves in summer. This ground-truth validation system provided valuable information about the scattering mechanisms of the three trees selected for analysis in different seasons, which can be detected by broadband polarimetric ground-based SAR measurements. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent polarimetric performance of the newly developed SAR imaging system, which should find many useful and immediate applications in noninvasive ground-truth validation of diverse terrestrial vegetation covers.},

  Abstract                 = {The polarization diversity of the phase causes ambiguities in the estimation of displacements using differential interferometry. Over natural surfaces such as vegetated areas, the magnitude of these ambiguities is potentially related to complex dynamic processes such as vegetation growth. As the properties and possible origins of such diversity (besides noiselike influences) over changing vegetation canopies are virtually unknown, we propose to investigate them empirically using an L-band zero-baseline data set covering one growing season over different agricultural crops. We frequently observe HH–VV phase differences exceeding 0.5$\pi$, corresponding to a displacement discrepancy of 3 cm. The HH–VV phase difference and other properties of the polarimetric coherence regions (e.g., the shape and the relation to the in situ observed biomass) vary with the crop type. The observations over wheat and barley and, to a lesser extent, rape suggest the presence of birefringence within the canopy. By contrast, those over maize and sugar beet, while also showing phase diversity, cannot be explained by birefringence or similarly simple models. Irrespective of the origin of this dependence, its presence and systematic nature indicate the potential importance of vegetation effects in differential interferometry, which may limit the accuracy of the estimated deformations over vegetated areas.},

  Abstract                 = {Displacements of the Earth's surface can be estimated using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar. The estimates are derived from the phase difference between two radar acquisitions. When at least three such acquisitions are available, one can compute the displacement between the first and the third acquisition and compare it with the sum of the two intermediate displacements. These two are expected to be equal for a piston-like spatially uniform deformation. However, this is not necessarily the case in measured data. Such lack of phase closure can be due to decorrelation noise alone. It has also been attributed to complex scattering processes such as soil moisture changes or multiple scattering sources. However, the nature of these nonrandom effects is only poorly understood in cold regions, as the role of snow and freeze/thaw processes has not been studied to date. To distinguish the noise-like and the systematic effects, an asymptotic Wald significance test is proposed. It detects situations when the observed closure error cannot solely be explained by noise. Such situations with are observed at the Ku-band during snow metamorphism and melt and following a summer precipitation event in Sodankyl?, Finland. They can also be prevalent ({\textgreater} 25{\%}) in the X-band observations of ice-rich permafrost regions in the Lena Delta, Russia, indicating the presence of processes that can have systematic and deleterious impacts on the estimation of surface movements. Satellite-based monitoring of these displacements is thus possibly subject to complex error sources in high-latitude regions.},
